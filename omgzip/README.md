# OMGzip

Custom compression format written in Python. Players need to decompress the flag.

This challenge has 1 downloadable artifact (`omg.zip`) and **no** running services.


## Challenge Text
This challenge is intended as an easier reverse engineering challenge for players unfamiliar with the category or assembly.

Inside the file below, you will find a Python script and a compressed flag file. Read over the Python code, write code that does the *opposite*, and decompress the flag.

The original version of this challenge was pretty trivially solvable by ChatGPT, so I made it more difficult before its release and added a bunch of random comments and changed a bunch of variable names to make doing that take more time. We'll see if I was successful or not.


## Building
Type `make`, observe that `build/omg.zip` now exists.
