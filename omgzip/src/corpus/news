Is the following conjecture reasonable and/or provable? :

Given a sequence of digits, starting with a non-zero digit, of arbitrary
but finite length, is it always possible to extend this sequence by
appending more digits, in such a way as to form a prime?

e.g. the sequence 1 can be extended into a prime in an infinite number
of ways, as in 13, 17, 19, 101, 1231, 1579, etc (there an infinite
number of primes beginning with a 1 by Bertrand's postulate).
However, it is far more difficult to try and locate a prime which
starts with the sequence 1528296922945708 (although at least one is known).

My personal opinion is that the conjecture is reasonable, simply because
one can keep adding digits at the end and checking for primality ad
infinitum, and the law of averages will do the rest. Of course this is
totally groundless mathematically, so can anyone provide a heuristic
argument with more weight?

Sure it can do anything. The best way for a programmable text editor to
simulate a structure editor would be for it to build an internal 
representation (or structure) or what was really being edited and then 
use its text manipulating primitives to show the user the effect of his 
editing commands on the structure that is "really" being edited. Now you've
shown that mocklisp (for example) is a language in which you can implement
a structure editor. I doubt if it is the best way to do it though.

I don't know about "commands", but Common Lisp comments are nothing
like Common Lisp code (much to the shame of Common Lisp). I want the
characters I type in as comments treated differently than those I type in 
as parts of S-expressions.

You're right. An editor which is really editing the structure underlying

But it is one of the reasons Xerox structure editor fans are fans.

No offense intended, but I could tell. If you write any Lisp you should
look for an opportunity to try SEdit on a D-machine.

  No way. Brand is "a figure both like Bleys and myself. My features, though
smaller, my eyes, Bleys' hair. There was a quality of both strength and weak-
ness, questing and abandonment about him." This is Corwin speaking, of course.

  And Bleys is "a fiery bearded, flame-crowned man, dressed all in red and
orange, mainly of silk stuff, and he held a sword in his right hand and a
glass of wine in his left, and the devil himself danced behind his eyes, as
blue as Flora's, or Eric's. His chin was slight, but the beard covered it."

  I can't think of anyone offhand for either part, but I nominate Gene Simmons
to play Caine: "Then came the swarthy, dark-eyed countenance of Caine, dressed
all in satin that was black and green, wearing a dark three-cornered hat set
at a rakish angle, a green plume of feathers trailing down the back." (Yeah,
I got "Nine Princes in Amber" lying right next to the keyboard here)

  Random: "a wily-looking little man, with a sharp nose and a laughing mouth
and a shock of straw-colored hair." How about Dudley Moore (with his hair
bleached, of course).

  Dierdre: "a black-haired girl with [Flora's] blue eyes, and her hair hung
long and she was dressed all in black, with a girdle of silver about her
waist." Lee Meriwether or Kate Jackson.

  Fiona: "with hair like Bleys or Brand, [Corwin's] eyes, and a complexion
like mother of pearl.  Ann-Margret!

  That's all for now; if people are interested I can type in the whole 2-1/2
pages of descriptions so we'll REALLY have something to argue over.

The answer is perhaps. In an ideal world, everyone will adhere to one
standard for mail headers - RFC822 possibly, but X.400 is more likely.
Until that glorious day arrives (if it ever does), mailers at the mail
'gateways' between networks will have little option but to munge
addresses because of incompatible mail headers and addressing formats.

What you mail system should do is rewrite mail headers into the
appropriate form for transmission to a given host. In short, if your
uucp neighbours only understand bang-style addresses, you mailer should
only present bang-style paths to these sites. If some sites understand
RFC822 (user@host.domain), then you should send them RFC822 style mail.
What would be less easy for the mailer is separating your bang-stlye
uucp neighbours from those who understand RFC822.

The best mailers (MMDF or sendmail - no flames please!) take an input
address, convert it to a canonical form and then rewrite the address in
the appropriate style for the message transfer agent. This is the most
sensible way of dealing with hybrid addresses like A!B@C. [Does that
mean send by uucp to A for relaying to user B on host C or does it mean
send to C for them to relay to user B on uucp host A? Then what if C
(or A) doesn't like addresses with '!' (or '@') signs in them?]

  Yea, verily, I recall The Questor Tapes. I've forgotten the scientist's
name, but he was a very rich and secretive genius known for several major
advances in robotics and cybernetics. About 2 years previous to the start
of the movie, he had disappeared, leaving only a partially completed project
he called Questor. Much of the work was complete, including a small fusion
reactor, most of the brain, and a lot of the support machinery. He also left
a BIG mag tape of programs, which some government idiot had partially erased
while trying to decode it. Questor, when activated, did nothing; the team
that assembled him figured it was because of the bad tape.

  Late that night, Questor got up, used the 'finishing' molds to give himself
human features, and walked out. The scientist had known one member of the
Questor-assembly team and put his name and address on the program tape; by
good fortune it had survived the attempted decoding. Questor knows only that
he must find `a boat' -- other details have been erased.

  The government catches up with them in a playground and some fool shoots
Questor. Apparently the shock knocks some bits loose because when he sees
a jungle gym that looks like Noah's Ark he remembers, "the boat, the boat
of legend. [whatsisname] is waiting for me there." He also remembers that
if he doesn't find the scientist within about two days, his fusion power
supply is programmed to overload and blow up.

  They patch him up and he leads them a merry chase to Mt. Ararat where he
finds his creator in a cave hidden by a force barrier/hologram projection.
There is a long row of metallic slabs suspended about a meter above the
floor; on each lies a defunct robot. Each one wears clothing from a time
far earlier than the next. Questor's creator lies on the second to last
slab, still conscious but unable to move.

  These robots have been watching over the human race for more than ten
thousand years. Each one lasts two hundred years, then builds his successor.
Questor's predecessor was brought to an early end by some combination of
pollution and radiation exposure; he has provided Questor with extra
shielding so he will last the full two centuries.

  Questor is the last. By the end of his term, the human race will have
reached a point where we can make our own decisions without guidance.
The robots were placed here by some advanced aliens to see us through our
racial childhood, to allow us a chance to mature and achieve whatever
potential we have.

  The Questor Tapes was an excellent movie, one makers of more recent films
should take a lesson from. Very few other movies have impressed me as much
as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "The Questor Tapes". They show up the likes
of"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "E.T." for the vapid silliness
they are.

By far the best thing I have read by MJH is a long short story called
"Running Down", about a man with unwanted psychic powers that cause things
to malfunction, decay and fall apart around him. It is set in a Britain
in the near future of when the story was written (i.e. about now) in which
the whole society reflects a similar dingy, pointless chaos - remarkably
like Britain after 8 years of Thatcher, in fact.
He's very good at describing that sort of situation - his novel "The Centauri
Device" does it at length, though his suggested political solution is bloody
stupid. His understanding of anarchism is about on a level with Robert Anton
Wilson's.

Tippett moved on a LONG way musically after "A Child Of Our Time".
I believe his masterpiece is the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello.
There is a wonderful recording of it by Pauk, Imai and Kirschbaum with the LSO
under Davis.
A problem I find with a lot of his music is the silly words. The man really
shouldn't have tried writing his own libretti that often.
I believe he's got another opera in the pipeline, due for its premiere in the
next few months.

OK - I've changed my spinning watch back into the lovely sand-timer
(remember the good old days?);  I've changed the CURS resource in the
Finder and also in the System so that I have various quantities
of sand in the top & bottom, but there is still a watch lurking!

More precisely, where does the watch that says 9 o'clock live, as
now I get the magic watch followed by the sand1->7, then the watch
again as the cycle repeats.  This only happens in the Finder, so I
suspect that there must be a watch lurking elsewhere, but where?

Last weekend a friend and I strolled into a music shop and ended up playing
with the new Casio MG500 MIDI guitar linked into a Roland MT-32. I don't
play guitar, and was just along for the curiosity, but I've got a few comments
to make and a question about what I consider to be a MIDI bug in one of the
instruments.
   Firstly - the performance of the MG500. I wasn't actually playing it (I was
just pushing buttons on the MT-32 instead), but I was impressed with its
speed and tracking ability - it was fast and followed pitch accurately,
responding to pitch bend and so on; it generally sounded pretty tight.
There were a couple of things I didn't like - but maybe it's a generic
weakness of all guitar-to-MIDI systems. Firstly, the guitar transmits
velocity information (hit the string harder -> louder/brighter note), but
gives no control (other than pitch-bend) once a note's sounding - there's
nothing equivalent to aftertouch/modulation so once a note sounds you're
at the mercy of the synth until you stop the string.
Point two - You've got six strings, so you can only sound six synth voices.
This is probably obvious, but playing a guitar patch through MIDI doesn't
sound like a real guitar, because each touch of a string retriggers the voice
on that string, sometimes in a rather distracting way. On a real (classical)
guitar you have the resonance of the soundbox to hang on to notes so you
aren't aware of this (I presume - comments?)
Now for what is (in my opinion) a MIDI Bug! Play two different notes on
two strings and you get two voices - ok so far. Play the same note on two
different strings and you get one voice. Humm. Play two different notes on
two strings and slide one note up to the other, and one of the voices is
chopped off. I think this is a bug - something somewhere doesn't want to
the same note more than once. Needless to say, this completely screws up
a number of guitar chords.
   We mentioned this to the guy in the shop. He seemed convinced that it's
a problem with the MIDI spec. itself - if you play a keyboard synth, you
have to release the middle C key to play it again, don't you? I think this
is a load of dingos kidneys - if I send my D-50 two separate middle C
note on messages, then I'll get two voices cycling through the envelopes at
middle C pitch. This is what happens with the sustain pedal on, as well.
   What's the verdict, net people? I think the guy was wrong (quite adamant,
but wrong...) and there's a bug in one of the boxes. I suspect the MG500.
If the MT-32 is anything like the D-50, then it doesn't care about playing
the same note twice. (A quick note in passing that synths with less voices
(Juno106 for instance) often won't double a voice, in an attempt to play
chords properly without running out.)

You might try looking to see if K-Resource is still available (by Kuma Software,
who else?).  It's been out a long while.  It's now available bundled with some
of the MetaComCo stuff (in particular the new Lattice C) but I believe that
Kuma still do it separately as well.  Don't have a clue what it costs, but
must be cheaper than a new compiler.

It produces (by switch option) appropriate 'include' type files for C,
FORTRAN, and 2 other languages which I've conveniently forgotten -- in
addition to the expected .RSC file.  Will also produce a 'non-specific
structured description' file (they say, I've never tried this) which is
alleged to be pretty easy to massage into an appropriate 'include' for
any unsupported language you might like.

The documentation is written in a bit of a 'too-folksy' style for my liking,
but the program is pretty intuitive to use which makes up for some of that.
It does, however, assume that you have some sort of a clue as to what the
various resource items/flags mean and do -- it doesn't teach you how to use
RSC files or what they mean, but rather gives a handle for making them.

I think I have found a bug in the latest version of Gulam.

         alias test 'echo $<'

produces a couple of spurious charcters on the input line.

         $<%&

The characters are usually above $80. The alpha version didn't do this.
I just delete them by backspacing anyway.

         echo $<

by itself works fine.

	Being curious, as the name was completely new to me, I borrowed 
	the Hyperion CD of Durufle's Requiem from my local public 
	library. I enjoyed it very much and would like to find out more
	about him, so :-

	- What else has he written? (I believe he's not been very prolific)
	
	- What else has been recorded?
	
	- Is his other work similar to the Requiem; it is better, worse or
	  just different?

	- I thought I heard a Holst influence; is this typical?

	- Are there other 20th Century composers in a similar vein that I
	  should try?

	lots of stuff about how to install smail deleted.

I have just installed smail 2.5 on Xenix 386.  The solution I used
here was to replace /usr/lib/mail/execmail with a link to (copy of)
/bin/smail.  I also moved the old sco execmail to execmail.sco and used
it as the local delivery agent.  The above will not work as it stands
because the command syntax for execmail is not the same as smail. This
can be corrected by swapping the meaning of the -F and -f switches in
smail (main.c and defs.h).   The local delivery macro in defs.h should
be set to give /usr/lib/mail/execmail.com -f from to.   With this
setup you get the sco mailer (mailx) and smail with both From and From:
lines correct.  Also as execmail is still used for 'local' delivery
micnet (sco's RS232 "LAN") still works.

This least-squares fit still passes through the "center of gravity" of the
data points, so assume that the data has been reduced such that the
averages of the x- and y-coordinates are both zero.  Let the equation of
the line to be determined be

    x*(sin phi) - y*(cos phi) = 0,

that is, it is the line making an angle phi with the x-axis.  Put

    XX = SUM_i x[i]^2,
    XY = SUM_i x[i]*y[i],
    YY = SUM_i y[i]^2.

Then tan(2*phi) = 2*XY/(XX-YY).

This gives two solutions for phi.  Take the one such that the point
(XX-YY, 2*XY) lies on the ray through the origin with angle 2*phi.
(Remark.  It is possible to solve the coefficients for x and y
algebraically, without going through the arctan routine, but it is harder
then to get the signs correct.)

The question was asked why an ARSA controller might want to know your
destination.

Actually, what they really want to know is where you're going *now*, like
'direct PMD' or 'following I5 northbound' (I have *no* idea of what type of
airspace that will take you through at any given altitude) or whatever course,
heading, or whatever you intend to take through the ARSA.

Now, if you're going to get flight following, the controller is going to want
to know your complete route of flight for which you want flight following,
so that it can be entered into the machine and the autumated handoffs can be
used between sectors and facilities.

As for why, that's very simple.  For purposes of calling traffic, which I
consider to be sufficient, if no one else does.  The same reason the
controller at the VFR tower asks your direction of departure.  If nothing
else, the controller can always tell the left downwind departures 'traffic a
(whatever) reported 6 SE for a left base entry', or whatever is appropriate.

MY opinions ONLY!

        Don't forget the special treads which would appear on his tires

        Every now and then, I remember that they would add a new option
        (boy, don't you wish your friendly neighborhood dealership would
         offer some of these for your car?).  Unfortunately, it has been
        many years since I last saw Speed Racer, but I do remember one 
        episode which added little winglets which would come out from under-
        neath the doors.  This added a little gliding ability.  Any one

       - Ultraman was one of several incredibly popular shows in Japan during
         the late 60s/early 70s/early 80s.  Actually, there were several shows
         each featuring one or more of the "Ultra" brothers, of whom Ultraman
         was the "leader/head/eldest (you get the idea)".  There was also
         Ultra 5 and a bunch of others which I can't remember and it would 
         take a long time to dig out the books.  There was something of a
         revival when UltraMan 80 (?) was released in Japan.  

         Of these, I believe that only the original Ultraman was released
         and dubbed for the American market.

       - By the way, Hayata would be the way to spell his name (though it
         would be more accurately pronounced by you gaijin as "Hiyata".
         
       - Of course, there is nary a trace of him now in Japan.  Programs
         have this incredible tendency of grabbing hold of everyone, then
         they drop it for something new.

I have encountered a problem trying to make a shell script that would
make incremental backups at nighttime without operator attendance.
The problem results from dump(8) program requiring occasional
responses from the operator through /dev/tty.  The script is
run from another script, /usr/adm/daily, under cron control and has no
controlling terminal, so it just hangs trying to read /dev/tty.  It would
be ok if dump just aborted when facing a situation that would require
operator intervention. The script should never hang in a loop under
any circumstances, because /usr/adm/daily must do other things too
and finish after a reasonable time.

Currently I have the dump script run a background subshell that sleeps for
an hour and then kills the dump script (if it still runs) and all dump
processes.  This is very complicated, however, and the watchdog process
is almost 50% of the whole script.  It is also very slow - I would
like it to stop immediately if it finds an error, report it to log file,
rewind the tape, and let /usr/adm/daily continue its work.

Has anyone out there in the Netland have any suggestions of what to do?
Can yes(1) somehow be piped to a program that reads /dev/tty?
Could dump(8) be modified to abort at errors without any questions?
What kind of unattended backup systems do you have?

I think that these wines would be particularly bad for sauces that require
wine as a major component and require reducing the wine. There are two
reasons that come to mind:

1) What is normally labeled as cooking wine is usually wine that is not good
enough to sell as table wine. If the taste is not the best, reducing it will
only concentrate its flaws.

2) Cooking wines contain salt. Reducing a cooking wine will concentrate the
salt. This could really ruin the sauce. 

There best reason I have seen for using a good wine to cook with was given
by Alexis Bespaloff in the "New Signet Book of Wine", which states

 "Furthermore, it is actually uneconomical to buy cheap wine for cooking.
  Say that an elaborate lobster dish calls for a spoonful or two of sherry
  to heighten its flavor. A cook who runs out to buy a bottle of cheap
  sherry will diminish the taste of an expensive and time-consuming dish with
  a quarter's worth of wine. What's more, because the wine is a poor example
  of its type, it may not be enjoyable to drink, so the spoonful of wine has,
  in fact, cost the full price of the bottle."

That is fairly sound reasoning. Of course, the last sentence does not
necessarily follow. You could keep the cheap wine around to diminish several
meals.

BTW, I recommend the "New Signet Book of Wine" to anyone who wants to learn
more about wine. It is available for $4.50 as a paperback. Quite a value
when you compare it to the $20-or-more, glossy coffee-table wine books out
on the market.

My friend told me that they said "Tales.. is not on CD." That's why he didn't

I have just finished singing (in choir) under Hogwood, it was an experience. We
sang Schuberts Mass in G, (as Schubert wrote it, missing a few phrases of the
Credo). Hogwood knew exactly what he wanted, and worked till we did it right.
Then as we tidied up the last few problems, he would let us sing through whole
sections, then go back and point out all the problems.

We also sang the Messiah (not with Hogwood unfortunately) the delight of
those performances was Elizabeth Cambells singing "He was despised..."

In this performance the two trumpeters waited off stage until just before their
appearances in each half, the first trumpet parts were played by a large
trumpeter (in nice to see that Sydney musicains are not starving) on what
looked like a very small valved trumpet (trumpet in F??).

1) Mr. Konar, press the 'n' key immediately! There's another arrogant
   audiophile going to pollute the net with his view on the Digital vs.
   Analog issue.

2) I'm not very much acquainted with the news stuff on the net, but it
   seems we don't receive the rec.audio newsgroup here in Europe. Can
   something be done about that?

3) Now let me come to the point.
   In article <3051@batcomputer.tn.cornell.edu> eacj@batcomputer.tn.cornell
   (Julian Vrieslander) he writes:
>Konar than goes on to comment about the "arrogance" of audiophiles who still

I agree with him, so let me do my bit now. A technology not being perfect
, or getting close to that, is still worth a discussion. Remember that it
took about a 100 years of thorough research from Edison's first grammophone
to the modern high quality turntables. Don't expect digital audio to be
perfect now only a few years after its introduction, no matter what the
commercial guys say. They are only interested in your hard-earned $$$$.

Until now I have only been in the opportunity to make a good comparison
between a high-end turntable and some first genaration. I'll summarize
the pros and cons of which I think are important and which I can think of
now. Many of them are well known, others may not.

PROS OF ANALOG:
- Cheap records.
- As John Vrieslander mentioned: More real, more spatious, more delicate,
  more emotionally involving. I won't try to find other words for this
  description 'cause I can't think of a better one. Unfortunately, this
  can only be heard on good, say > $2k-$3k systems without an infinite
  number of knobs, lights and other gadgets normally found in aeroplane
  cockpits.

CONS OF ANALOG:
- More hissy, rumble,scratches,sound degrading after many times of
  playing the record. This counts less when you have good records
  (Japanese ones are most often excellent but hard to get now.) and take
  good care of them.
- No flat frequency response, especially at the low and high end.
- Phase distortion.
- Harmonic distortion increases with amplitude.

PROS OF DIGITAL:
- Longer durability than records (?). Less hissy, no rumble or ticks of
  scratches.
- Almost no phase distortion, flat frequency response within the audio
  range.
- Easy to use.
- Slightly (!) more dynamic. Why only slightly? Well, the 96 dB dynamic
  range theoretically possible with a CD is not very practical. In reality
  it is compressed, as far as I know, to some 40-60 dB depending on the
  music (Pop, Jazz, Classic) because:
  a) No one wants to run continuously to his volume knob to adjust the
     volume.If not compressed the music will either be banging through your 
     living room and of your neighbours or it will drown in the inevitable 
     background noise.
  b) Studio equipment has a dynamic range of less than, say, 70 to 80 dB
     when you assume the Signal to Noise ratio being equal to the dynamic
     range.
  c) Sound gets to distorted at low levels. (See also cons)
  d) A dynamic headroom of 10 dB is desired.
  With all this limitations the dynamic range of CD's is not much different
  with that of a good record.
- Excellent bass response. Deep and well defined.
- Very stable stereo image.

CONS OF DIGITAL:
- Expensive records.
- When listening to a CD, it seems as if there is no "space" around around
  the instruments and voices. It sounds cold and not very lively.
- First generation players and the cheaper CD players nowadays suffer from
  very distorted high tones. They sound harsh. Cymbals for instance sound
  like someone is sawing them into pieces instead giving it a gentle hit
  with a drum-stick. They do not sound crisp and clear.
- Distortion increases dramatically with lower amplitudes (!). It can be
  more than 1.5 % at low levels. And it's a very nasty kind of distortion.
- CD players produce (digital) noise above the audio range. This noise itself
  can not be heard but other audio equipment may suffer from intermodulation
  distortion which brings this noise back in the audio range. 
- Many CD players, especially the first ones, do not seem to be very reliable
  mechanically.
- I've heard that digital audio recording is quite different from analog.
  I mean in terms of how it has to be done properly. I don't mean the
  equipment needed, that's quite obvious. Not all studio crew seem to know
  how to make a good digital recording. Does anyone know more about that?

Well, this must be enough stuff to think and talk about.

The above mentioned cons of digital audio may be overcome in the latest
players but I have not had the opportunity until now to carefully listen
to them and to compare them. According to some serious audio magazines
available here in Holland they seem to be improved. Many top-of-the-line
models now have separated power supplys for the digital and analog
circuitry, opto-couplers between those circuits, an additional analog filter
to filter out > 20 kHz noise, 16 bit with with n times oversampling, stable
and rigid chassis and improved error correction. All this may have solved
(some) of the cons I mentioned but I'm not sure. Players which have one or
more of these improvements and thus may be of interest (At least for Julian
Vrieslander and me) are: Philips (Magnavox in the USA I believe) CD 650 and
CD 960, Nakamichi, Mission, Meridian and if memory serves me well, Acoustical
Research (Or Audio Research. Don't know anymore). The latter two may be
difficult to get in the USA, they are made in the UK. No doubt that there
are more good CD players but can't think of others now. These are the
players I consider buying when normal LP's are no longer available.

Pooh! That was more than I intended to write but still far less than I can
tell about this stuff.

                                        Kind regards from
                                        Jan Postma

Using the  GNU emacs terminal-emulator   to run interactive  programs  would be
quite limited if the parent emacs  can't be used  for editing (when the program
run under the emulator starts up an editor).  While some  programs  (like `rn')
allow to explicitely specify the  editor, a general  solution would require  to
specify `emacsclient'  in the `EDITOR'   environment  variable of  the  process
running under the terminal emulator.

Naturally this could be done by running  the  shell under the emulator, setting
the   environment of  the shell, and  then running   the program  we are really
interested  in.  A  better way  would be    to set  the   environment from  the
`terminal-mode-hook'. Is there any means to achieve this???? (I'm running GNU
Emacs version 18.49.)

No, why should they? There may be songs on the album that are 
very good listening to at home, but just doesn't make it live,
just as there are songs with the opposite character; good live, 
but just a bore on disc.

Deep Purple and Marillion and good example of extremes in both
ends. When I saw D.P. in February this year, they played three 
of the ten songs from "The House of Blue Light", their latest 
album. That is a quite decent product, but I didn't miss those
songs anyway. (I, and everyone else, would have been much more 
disappointed if they had left out "Smoke on the Water".) 
  Marillion on the other hand; on the two tours they made after
"Misplaced Childhood", they insisted on playing entire album
as one long song. There are many parts on that album that just
becomes dead passages where nothing happens when they are played
live. ("Bitter Suite" and "Blind Curve" for instance.) Marillion
is no good live band, and playing obsolete material does not
make things better.

Grady seems to be confusing the issue a bit here. He talks about fusion and 
the mentions groups that belong(ed) to the symphonic-rock genre. (I prefer
that term instead of "progressive") For me "fusion" is a synonym with 
jazz-rock. Anyway, that is more of question of semantics, the two genres 
have a lot in common. (The main difference maybe being that symphony-rock 
is European and fusion American.)

The reason why these groups are being discussed the most is probably that
they have gained the greatest commercial succes. This may or may not 
be correlated to the fact they are the best.

Being quite fond of this kind of music, I feel obliged to comment. It's
a real mixture Grady presents and I must admit there are names I have 
never heard. Anyway, I think he is a bit unfair, some of them have 
certainly been discussed on the net. For instance, I posted a discograhpy 
on Brand X some month ago. Some comments to the other names:
  PFM (Premiata Forneria Marconi) have been mentioned from time to time,
the Italian answer on Genesis, which developed in a different way. Now
disbanded, I believe. One day or another may be I'll post a discography.
  Quiet Sun. The band in which Phil Manzanera played before he joined
Roxy Music. Their "Mainstream" is rather like jazz, but not mainstream.
  Seventh Wave. This is the name I never expected to see on the net! I
bought their "Things to Come" when I was 15 and I was really fond of it
then. These days I don't find that amount of synthesizers so exciting as
I did then.
  Wheather Report. Quite well-known. But really, you do only need "Heavy
Wheather", the one with "Birdland". May be some more, "Mysterious Traveller"
perhaps, but then you'll find that they all sound the same.

>As I said before, I find much of Yes and ELP to be very dull, and un-
>affecting.  I like Rush, though more live than on record.  

As you can guess, I don't share Grady's view here. Yes has made good
music, yet never really touched my soul, probably due to their utterly
stupid and semi-religious lyrics. "Brain Salad Surgery" is a very good
record, the rest of what ELP have done is so-so. Rush don't turn me on 
at all, on the other hand. The net discussion inspired me to try 
"A Farewell to Kings" (A random choice). May be I would have liked them 
10 years ago, but not today with those lyrics and that voice.

>So, were Yes, ELP, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis and Rush really "it"
>as far as most progrock fans go, or did some of these "lesser known" artists
>(and all the others I forgot or never knew) filter out to larger audiences?

Depends on how you define your terms here, but I can easily think 
of more groups, some of them succesful, some of them not, some of them
good, some them not so good:
Kansas, Saga, Asia, Jethro Tull, Roxy Music, Gentle Giant, Van Der Graaf
Generator, George Duke, Billy Cobham, Al DiMeola, Herbie Hancock, Dixie
Dregs, Ange, (Mahavishnu) John McLaughlin, Santana, Bill Bruford etc
  I think that most of these people have had their share of the discussion
on the net. So to conclude, I do not really share Grady's initial obser-
vation. However some particular groups are certainly being over-discussed,
namely Rush, Yes and recently also Pink Floyd.

My friend bought a Siel DK80 synthesizer and now he is wondering how
the sequencer in that machine works.
 
 
Unfortunately we don't have any manuals for it.
 
Could somebody kindly send me information concerning this problem?
 
Thank you!

Hi there,

I'm actually working on C++ re-hacks of the X11 include files.
There are some problems with Xlib.h. In structures
Visual, XWindowAttributes and XColormapEvent there are variables named
``class'' and ``new'' which cause serious problems (C++ keywords) !

For the moment I've changed the names, but this is an awful hack. Does anybody
know a better solution ?

[If there's a Microport newsgroup, it doesn't come here]

				Background

AT&T's generic UNIX V.3 for the 80386 (as sold in binary form by AT&T,
Bell Technologies, Intel, Interactive Systems, Microport, Prime etc.)
will run binaries created for UNIX V.2 on the 80286.  A large number of
packages exists for AT&T's 6300 Plus, an 80286-based system running V.2.
These can be run on 80386-based systems while you're waiting for
software authors to come up with native 80386 ports of their products.

				Problem

You are supposed to load packages onto your 6300 Plus using the system's
administration procedures.  These handle weird multi-volume cpio diskette
sets, which are a pig to load unless you have the installation software.
Which you don't if you're trying to load the software onto an 80386-based
system running 386/ix, Microport, or whatever.

				Solution

Here's a shell script which does the job.  If you want to know the details,
it reads 350k, starting at offset 9k, from each 360k diskette in the
installation set, piping the result into cpio -c.  It the fires off the
Install program which should be part of the application package.  As the
comments remark, there's not a lot of error checking, as it's essentially
a quick hack.  Also, testing is about at the ``worked twice in a row''
level.  Despite all that, I hope it's useful to somebody out there.

It has already been done.  The program should be in /usr/demo/SRC/shaded.c,
the shuttle data is in /usr/demo/DATA/space.dat.  There are notes on running
it in /usr/demo/README.  The program displays 2 windows with cursor lines, to
enable you to select the 3d viewpoint, and there's a pop-up menu for setting
fill style and colour, &c.  For monochrome you need to select the "edges" (I
think) fill style or it'll look pretty wierd.  Also, if your display surface
doesn't support hidden surface removal, you'll get a wireframe effect that
can be confusing to the eye.

/usr/demo/DATA also contains data files for an icosahedron, a pyramid, a
ball and a Klein bottle.

I find this statement hard to believe, based on the quality
of his book "Circumpolar". It is full of characters which
barely qualify as two dimensional, offensive racial stereotypes
and various other assorted characters whose collective IQ doesn't get
into double figures. I rated this book as -****.

I cannot believe that someone who turned out such complete

I am however, willing to be surprised. What other books of

/.. of course!!

If you add directories above root (and remember that with the Newcastle
Connection, /.. was just a directory rather than some mysterious 
"super-root") so that it is possible for your current directory to
be in an uncle or cousin relationship with root (rather than a direct
descendent), then you have to modify the pwd algorithm accordingly.

pwd assumes that if you go up the tree with ".." enough times you will
get to root. If your current directory is in a sideways relationship
to root, this assumption will no longer be valid.

The modified pwd algorithm should work like this:

(1) Go up the tree with .. from your current directory until you
find / or reach the base of the tree (a directory which is its own
parent).

(2) If you didn't reach / in (1), then starting from / go up to
the base of the tree with .. and prefix the appropriate number of
/..'s to the string from (1).

For example, after cd /../../C/D, step (1) will give /C/D and step (2)
will give /../.. so the answer is /../../C/D.

This is relatively straightforward to implement. I've made the necessary
modifications to the System V /bin/pwd and sh (which has a built-in pwd)
for use with a kernel implementation of the Newcastle Connection.

The tricky bit is getting the shortest possible pathname. For example,
if / corresponds to /../../A/B in the global naming tree, then after
cd /../C, the modified pwd algorithm would give /../../A/C which is
correct but redundant. (/../../A is the same as /.. if / is /../../A/B).

This can be fixed if you keep a record of everywhere you visit in (1) and
stop in (2) when you reach somewhere you've visited before, but since in
an infinite naming tree this would require an infinite amount of storage
and isn't very efficient in any case, it is easier to simply implement
the algorithm given (which also requires an infinite amount of storage
in the general case of course!) and ignore this problem.

Does anyone have any recommendations for and/or experience of hard disk
optimisers for the ST?

The only ones I have come across are Simon Poole's DLII and Michtron's
Tune Up! (their exclamation mark, not mine).

I have tried neither (DLII did some strange things with a ram disk I 
tested it on, and I'd rather not pay for Tune Up! until I have some
favorable reports on it) and would be very interested in  anyone's
experiences with the above or any other such beasts.

Thanks.

The observer, if he waited around long enough, would also
see the black hole evaporate by Hawkins' radiation.

But, from the point of view of the observer, the "poor fellow"
can never cross the event horizon before the hole evaporates
away from under him.

Therefore, the "poor fellow" must observe one of two things.
Either he crosses the event horizon in a finite amount of
time, or he will observe the black hole to vanish as he
approaches.

1. sets up a paradox, but 2. implies that anything falling
into a black hole can't get into the black hole before it
evaporates. i.e. the black hole can't form in the first
place. It just get very close to it.

Who we are and what we do:

As a company, we produce  custom  solutions  on  hand-held  and portable
equipment,  primarily   customising   Hewlett-Packard   hand-helds.  For
example, we recently installed almost 6 000 HP-71 hand-held computers as
networked  terminals in 430 DHSS offices as part of a Document  Tracking
System developed by us to a DHSS specification.

We're not just a software  house, but also develop custom  packaging and
electronics where necessary too.  Our customers are primarily government
departments  (here and abroad), but we have also  produced  products for
individual sale through dealers (such as the Zenwand-71 barcode wand for
the HP-71, which span off of the DHSS contract).

Although our products are almost exclusively  related to hand-helds, our
expertise  stretches through to custom chip design and  mainframe-hosted
software  packages  (mainly  under Unix).  As a  consequence,  we regard
ourselves as a solutions  house, rather than being specific to software,
hardware, design or whatever.

We have one  office [in  Leeds],  have been  around for seven  years and
employ over 40 people at present.  Is that a reasonable summary?

I may have missed some of this thread, but I haven't heard anyone mention
Satie yet. His Vexations for piano is meant to be repeated 840 times
(it takes about 18 hours to perform). He also wrote some pieces of music
to be played in particular spaces - "Music for a Boardroom" is one
that comes to mind - which go round and round in circles. (I think that one
would produce some #@$% aggressive board meetings).

Our System Manager has reported that there is a problem with using EMULEX CS02
QBUS comms cards which are not at the latest revision level, under VMS 4.6.   
These cards appeared to work fine under VMS 4.5 and earlier.

The EMULEX CS02 card, configured as two DHV-11 8-line muxs, gives phantom
devices when running SHOW DEVICE.   For example, TXC0 to TXC7 become TXC0 to
TXC15.  There are problems in using the lines - for example Control-Y acts
on the group of lines not just one!  There are other problems known to EMULEX. 

The solution is to upgrade the firmware PROM on the card to at least
revision P.  Emulex may make a charge for this.

I am just preparing a 'semi-popular' lecture on how the
value of the Hubble Constant is determined.

As is generally
known, the values of different authors fluctuates between
ca. 50 to 100 km/(sec Mpc). The latest discussion of this
problem which I know of is M. Rowan-Robinson's book
"The Cosmological Distance Ladder" (Freeman 1985). He
advocates 67 km/(sec Mpc) after a detailed discussion of
the different distance indicators.

Now I would like to know: What is the current state of
affairs? The responses of the advocates of the various
values, for example by Sandage & Tammann or de Vaucouleurs
(= the grand old men of this topic)? Somehow I missed
their reactions. Can anybody give me a hint via e-mail?
I'll summarize.

Here is something which should do part of what you want. It doesn't
accomplish to start a new emacs process if you exited the last one
with C-x C-c - unless the first one had never been suspended!
Whenever you get "fg: No such job" just type ``i!!'', reinvoking the
commandline prefixed with an "i", "iemacs" standing for "init emacs".

alias emacs iemacs
alias iemacs 'alias emacs remacs; "emacs" \!* ; alias emacs iemacs'
alias remacs fg %emacs

Here we use a special version of suspend-emacs, that will look for a
file ".emacs_pause" in the user's home directory when emacs is
resumed. In this file suspend-emacs expects to find the current
working directory and an optional "command line" that is parsed like
the initial command line.  Very useful!
This could be done using "suspend-resume-hook", but the hook wasn't
available in 17.?? when this was first implemented here.

These are the aliases I use together with the special version of
suspend-emacs.

alias emacs iemacs
alias remacs 'echo `pwd` \!* >\! ~/.emacs_pause ; %emacs'
alias iemacs 'alias emacs remacs; "emacs" \!* ; alias emacs iemacs'
alias kemacs 'alias emacs iemacs; remacs -kill'

Could anyone please shed light on a problem I have in compiling the S
statistical package from AT&T on our Sun-3 system:

System specifics: Sun 3/260 under SunOS 3.4 using the m4 macro
processor supplied with the S system. S version date: Fri Feb 28 1986

Using the hints on compiling with BSD4.2 systems I only get apparently
harmless warnings under the compilation. This could for example be:

Warning on line 84 of hcp.f: local variable i never used
Warning on line 96 of stems.f: statement cannot be reached
f77: Warning: File with unknown suffix (/usr/local/src/s/S/newfun/lib/grz)
     passed to ld
or
"dprint.c", line 20: warning: illegal combination of pointer and integer, op =

Furthermore there are problems with the utility routine scandata.C, which
fails with error: too many local variables. This is fixed by making the
declaration of "table" global. Not pretty, but it works.

These are all the kinds of problems that appear during the
compilation, and it *will* result in an executable, except....
The f...ing system doesn't even know how to add two numbers, as seen in
the following:

One-time initialization for new S user in /usr.MC68020/iesd/tap/jpc ...
Directories swork and sdata created
> 1 + 2
Bad operator: +
Error in +
> 

Running the tests supplied with the system ($A/DOTEST ALL) will not
give better results. This is an excerpt from $TEST/current/apply:

> prefix("apply.")    # test of apply and multivariate stuff, some time-series
> $Random.seed_c(57,0,3,0,0,0,49,16,0,0,0,0)	# to initialize at same spot
> matr_matrix(rnorm(100),20,5)
Invalid distribution: rnorm
Error in rnorm
Dumped
> print(cm_apply(matr,2,"mean")); apply(matr,2,"var")
apply.matr not found
Dumped
 .
 .
and more depressing errors...
Why does the prefix command work, while the matr_matrix(rnorm... stuff don't?

So, have *anybody* made this run on a Sun system, and how did you do it?
All suggestions or pointers to which direction I should go, are welcome.

regards,

I experimented with offscreen pixmaps today. It seems that Color
Quickdraw is very flexible, but too slow for good animation. Most of the
overhead comes from color matching and conversion. I guess I could write
my own color matching routine, but I think there should be a fast way to
do a simple copy operation.

In most painting programs the actual painting could be done on an
offscreen bitmap with the same color table as the best gDevice.

It takes about twice as much time to do a copybits in srcCopy mode than
it takes in the srcXor mode. Below is a short program that draws to an
offscreen pixmap and then copies it back to the screen. Try different
transfer modes and note the speed difference. The code is written in LS
C 2.13. Even srcXor, which is the fastest usable mode, is too slow for
really high quality animation.

How can it be done faster?

#include <MacTypes.h>
#include <QuickDraw.h>
#include <Color.h>
#include <WindowMgr.h>

WindowPtr	onScreen;
CGrafPtr	offS;

	HLock(offS->portPixMap);
	offP=*(offS->portPixMap);

I have an A2090 card and a CSA68020/68881 board with no 32 bit ram.
 
 They will Not work together. (but both work seperately)

I think the driver (hddisk) is dated  1986 , is this the latest driver?
(If not could you please e-mail me the latest version)

The problem is when I run binddrivers that task stops, (binddrivers
never exits). It seems to fallover on a particular call to execbase.
The last instruction (displayed by MetaScope) is  mov a2,(a0)

If i move the hddisk from expansion draw , to hddisk.device in the
devs draw, i can mount the harddisk (dh0:) , but when i do a
cd dh0: , the cd command displays 'Cant find dh0:'

I am running morerows, 672*266 on a B2000 rev 4.0 board (pal) with
2Mbytes expansion ram , 2*3.5inch drives, and (hopefully) A2090 +
20 Mbyte hard disk, and a CSA 68020/68881 board.

I have also done the wire-link modification to the main B2000 board,
as required by CSA for the 68020 board on Rev4.0 and later boards.

Slots are as follows :-

     I  I  E  E  E  M  H     6
     B  B  M  M  M  E  A     8
     M  M  P  P  P  M  R     0

Here's a suggestion for an improvement (at least I think it is :-) to the
"pickup" option in nethack, which someone who is familiar with the source
code might like to implement -

Make the "pickup" option a composite option like "packorder", and re-write
the picking up code so that the types of objects specified will be
automatically picked up. All other objects could still be picked up by ','.

e.g. "pickup:?+/=!)"  would pick up scrolls, spellbooks, wands, rings,
                                   potions, and weapons.

This would be useful for those of us who don't like carrying hoards of
gold around, and also to prevent picking up dead cockatrices while still
picking up other objects.

BTW, does anyone know what the options "null" and "news" do?

This still has the same problem as with "errno"- namely that you're trying
to describe a general ``error condition'' using a single number! I'm told
that VMS (but it's a good idea for all that...) provides a stack of error 
values which allows a program to search backward to find out what the "real" 
error was, depending on what kind of detail is required. If you have several
levels of library calls between you and the system call that failed, this
can be extremely useful- it's not really much use having an error-value
if you can't even tell what system call it came from (let alone what parameters
were *passed* to that system call to cause it to fail!).

A *decent* error-returning mechanism would describe:

	1. What call (syscall or library call) failed.
	   This could be a number- you could use something like internet
	   addressing to put some kind of structure into it:
		libc.stdio.fopen
	2. Why it failed.
	   Simple E-numbers will do for this (although I suppose they'd
	   have to be grouped for different libraries):
		E_STDIO.E_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE
	3. What value it returned.
		(FILE *)NULL
	3. What parameters were passed to it.
	   This is the most difficult one, because it would have to have
	   some kind of idea as to the types involved. It could (I suppose)
	   deal only with string types (and convert any other type into
	   "printable" form by doing the equivalent of sprintf()'ing it).
	   It also has to be a "list", which means it would probably have
	   to be done using something like "argc,argv":
		argc: 2
		argv: "mumble.splat", "r"

If the error is not "dealt with", then this information should propogate
down (together with the info from the callee's failure), and so on...

So, If you do a
	fopen("mumble.splat","r")
and it fails, then the following would be left on the stack (in some format
or other) to be dealt with by some error-diagnosing function:

	kernel.open:
		param 1: "mumble.splat" [string]
		param 2: 0 [int]
		returns: -1 [int]
		error: E_KERNEL.ENOENT
	libc.stdio.fopen:
		param 1: "mumble.splat" [string]
		param 2: "r" [string]
		returns: 0 [FILE *]
		error: E_LIBC.E_STDIO.E_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE

The error-diagnosing stuff could then print something *useful* such as
	stdio fopen: couldn't open file "mumble.splat" for reading, because:
	    kernel open: no file or directory "mumble.splat"

(and of course the format of these messages could be user-configurable, so
that noddies would just get the information they need, whereas people who
understand what they're doing could get reams and reams of info- just by setting
some environment parameter to the appropriate value).

Of course, all this stuff would have to be known by the compiler, and I'm sure
it'd be dead slow to execute!

A local group is going to start a diplomacy game by mail. We have
only few players so I would like to take part in the game myself.
To do so, I would like to have the moves evaluated by a
program. Before writing such a program myself, I would like to
ask if anyone has or knows of such a program in the public
domain, preferrably written in C. Code or pointers to it will be
greatly appreciated.

This strikes me as quite odd.  I mean, if something can be done in two lifetimes
then, darn it, it is well within my imagination.
If it can be done within 20 lifetimes
I can still grasp how difficult it should be.  A real difficult thing would
be something that takes say 10^100 lifetimes.

In short, I find the above ad quite naive.  NSA guys should probably
have something better than this for the inspring encryption student.
What do you say?

This is really dangerous programming. The points where the left and where the
right "bar" are evaluated are implementation defined. The problem is similar to
another one, which a friend of mine had some time ago. He tried to pack as much
as possible into the control part of a while loop using the following statement:

while (a[i]=b[i++])
  ;

Things were even worse here, as the program behaved even differently depending
on whether it was compiled with the optimization option or not. Non optimized
everything worked as expected but in the optimized version only for the first
assignment "i" was incremented after the assignment, for all the following
assignments it was incremented after the evaluation of "b[i]" but before the 
assignment. Nevertheless this behaviour was in the sense of both K&R and ANSI.
The only thing you can trust on, is that the *operand* of the increment
operator is evaluated before its incrementation. One way to achieve the desired
behaviour is, as you suggested yourself, to write:

> What he really wanted was the equivalent of
> 	bar->tmp = bar;
> 	bar++;

and not (for the same reasons stated above):

> 	(bar++)->tmp = bar;

If there is any necessity to have the whole semantic in one *expression*, use
the comma operator, as

bar->tmp = bar, bar++;

This operator *guarantees* the sequential evaluation of its operands from
left to right.

For people interested, here are a couple of bugs in the Alcyon
compiler that we've been hitting our heads against for the last few
weeks:

	1) The compiler doesn't seem able to cope with nested
	   initialisations. For instance, a struct with an array in
	   the middle:
		static struct foo table[] = {
			{ ...... {.....} ......},
			...
		}
	   The compiler complains about mismatched braces.
	   Cure: 'unwrap' the struct declaration, so it's all at the
		 same level.

	2) In a construct like
		bar *p = (expression1, expression2);
	   the result of expression2 gets coerced to int, and then
	   back to bar *, meaning basically that you get bombs on the
	   screen when you try to use p, due to a wrong address.
	   Cure: use
		bar *p = (expression1, (bar *) expression2);

	3) We believe that 'complicated' initialisations to auto
	   variables in functions (for instance where the
	   initialisation involves a call to another function) often
	   come out wrong. However, by this point, we despaired, and
	   stopped using the compiler, so we never followed up on it.

I might point out that we're trying to compile a BIG program: 30,000
lines of C, so just trying to trace bug 2 took us a LOT of time.

By the way, just for interest: to compile the lot from scratch, using
a ram disk for temporaries would take 4 hours. When we reinitialised
the disk partition, and copied the files back, a recompile only took
1.5 hours!

I once implemented a syslogd for HP-UX using message queues. I have posted
it to comp.sources.unix some time ago, but I can mail it if you cannot find
it.

Features: (almost) BSD compatible, no network support, runs as a daemon,
communicates with message queues.
If no daemon is running, calling 'syslog' is effectivily a no-op.
I have used it when I tried to get sendmail running.

When I purchased VersaTerm 2+ years ago I didn't bother to register.
Now I wish I had. It's about time for an update.

The manual lists the address:
Peripherals Computers & Supplies Inc
2232 Perkiomen Avenue
Mt. Penn, PA 19606

Is this still current (other VersaTerm Users)?

In either case, an e-mail reply will be appreciated.
The dealer (I bought it from) here is still selling
the same version of two years ago. (1.42)

I have written a program to recursively compare the contents of two given
directories, file for file.  The program descends the tree and reports about
files that are missing or different.  Some day, if I ever get around to
producing V1.3 of MINIX, I will make a tree of the current version next to
the V1.2 tree, and then run this program to get a list of all files that
are different.  Then I can make diff listings etc.  In reality, the reason
I wrote it however, is that I had just copied my MINIX tree from one part
of the disk to another, and I wanted to make sure nothing was forgotten.
I am sure there are other uses as well.    One could no doubt write a shell
script to do this same thing, or perhaps use find, but this program is
much faster, being able to compare two 8 megabyte trees in about 12
minutes on a Z-248.

Please post any bugs you find.

1) We want to connect a laserprinter for use with troff
on a NCR Tower System. Has anyone experience with this?

2) We will have access to a KYOCERA F-1000 or F-1200 laser printer.
Does anyone know about the existence of a filter for the
troff output to the laserprinter (which uses 'Prescribe').

3) This laserprinter also has an HP Laserjet Plus emulation.
Another solution would then be to use a troff output filter
for the HP Laserjet.  So I will ask the same question
about the existence for this filter.

Please mail responses directly to me. If there are usefull
responses, I will post a summary to the net.

Well, you can do that by making each such pipeline belong to it's own SXT
device, and have all these SXT's multiplexed onto your *real* terminal.
Instant job-control!

BTW, SVR2 (and 3?) setpgrp() doesn't fully detach a process from its 
controlling tty if this process has already done a setpgrp() previously
(as is the case for a login-shell -- this comes from init and getty).
What it does in this case is to "partially" detach -- so that if you try 
to set up a new controlling terminal, it's not actually a controlling terminal 
at all -- things like terminal-generated signals don't get sent to the process.
Presumably this is just a cretinous bug, and not something more sophisticated.

In the book of the film, Valkris was definitely a Klingon, out to do something
valiant to redeem her family's honour. She became very friendly with another
alien on board that ship because of that alien's warrior traditions.

Any character may learn the Force skills from a master, and the rulebook even
encourages players using the Jedi characters to do some teaching, provided that
the pupil hasn't got any Dark Side points. Remember, Luke Skywalker was a
"Brash Pilot" type until Obi-Wan (OB1? :-) got to him.

Now for my question. There are some really nice pictures in the rulebook. Can I
get separate copies of these? They would be great posters, especially the
Imperial Navy recruiting poster and the R2 advert.

Sorry, there was only ever one original Max Headroom
programme. That was a one-off TV film made by the BBC.
Any episodes beyond the original story did not originate
with the BBC, although Maxs' creators may have been involved.

Max then re-appeared on Channel 4 as host of a chat show for two
short seasons. (interviewing guest stars about their views
on Golf, music, life and, most importantly, Golf :->)

He then crossed the atlantic to be re-made by ABC.

Egg released at least one other album before `Civil Surface', I think it
was called `the Polite Force'.  They were very good.

Their drummer (Clive Brooks?) joined the Groundhogs.
Their bassist (Mont Campbell?) played sometimes with some of the other
  Canterbury scene people: National Health, U.K. or similar (mid 70's).
Their organist, Dave Stewart, became a pop star (`It's My Party'), and
  also played with National Health, Hatfield & the North, etc.

Apologies for any wrong names - the above is all based on memory.

Oh no, not again. Remember last time, when the number of articles complaining
about ST articles outnumbered the articles concerned (and every other single
type of article as well)?

There is a ST group, but not for "all of us". Some of us can't get at it. But
your point about headers is valid. In the interests of preventing Flame War III
I suggest that those of us who wish to put ST (and Dr. Who, etc) articles here
make sure that "ST" (or Dr. Who, etc) or some similar warning appears in the
header. And those who wish to complain about such postings should also always
put some clear warning in the header, so those of us who aren't interested can
kill their articles easily.

A long time ago I read about a program developed at MIT that produced
images of the way ordinary scenes (a street) would look at speeds nearing
c. I don't know if it used a plotter or calligraphic display, but it was
so long ago that whatever it did should surely be possible now in real time
on a Mac or equivalent. Does anything like that exist? - a sort of flight
simulator for cosmic ray particles, that would let you define a scene
with a 3D graphics editor and then look at it at various fractions of c.
(Colour would be a nice optional extra). The MIT program produced weirdly
drooping lampposts.
More ambitiously: what about general relativity? Here I am thinking about
some of the descriptions in Kaufmann's "The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity" about how the world would look from near a black hole.

Multilink will allow several serial screens to run dos programs.

More info from:
	The Software Link
	3577 Parkway Lane
	Atlanta  GA 30092
	(404) 448 5465

They also have a product call PC-MOS that does the same thing on
386 boxes.  

Other software that lets you run multi user dos includes QNX,
Concurrent DOS (from Digital Research - remember CP/M :-),
Xenix (vp/ix comming soon), Unix V (ISC and Microport, with
vp/ix and locus merge respectivly).

Disclaimer: I don't sell any of the above - just write serial
driver's for them - not easy in some cases :-(

Subject:  Bug bug? solved (?)
Keywords: inline local variables

> ... Redeclaration of "_au2__Xt_val_global"

The conditional statement on the lines 161/162 "if ( base == BLOCK  &&
	n->lex_level < ( (Pfct(expand_fn->tp)->memof) ? 3 : 2 ) )"
in file expand.c has to be changed in:
"if (  base == BLOCK && n->lex_level < 'function-defined-in-class' ? 3 : 2  )".

For a function defined in a class the lex_level is raised by the curly brace
of the class itself. Not only member functions (memof = member of) can be
defined inline, friends can also.
(Note that funny declarations of local variables did appear in case a member
function which needs locals is declared inline but not defined in the class
itself).

The most simple way to tell whether a function is defined in a class is the
use of a global variable (the more globals the more fun), set and reset 
(embracing the first loop) in the routine classdef::simpl() in file simpl.c

This is only partly true.

"K.u.K." is short for "Kaiserlich und Koeniglich", that's right.
But it has nothing to do with the king of prussia.

At the time "K.u.K." was used, the king of Austria was also the
king of Hungary and the emperor of "Oestreich-Ungarn" (Austria and
Hungary. When thinking of K.u.K., I have the picture of
Kaiser Franz Josef, a fatherly man who kept his nation in a long
period of prosperous (sp?) peace, especially good for the arts.

BTW, Otto von Bismarck is remembered as a man who united Germany
(with an iron hand, that's true), which at that time was divided
into many small parts, all of them having a duke, different legislation
and borders between them. This meant having to pay customs very often,
thus disallowing free trade, which in turn was necessary for the
upcoming industrial revolution. So you might regard OvB a good statesman.

FOLDRXXX starts up with a little table of ROM versions and corresponding
to each version an address. At that address it inserts a list of memory
pieces to be used. If you use new ROM's these addresses have been changed
so you cannot use FOLDRXXX unless you figure out the new address you need
and substitute the necessary information into the binary of FOLDRXXX ( or
a disassembly ). On the other hand: the new version of the ROMs for the
Mega has a much larger OSpool from which these memory blocks are taken.
It used to be 6000 bytes, but the new size is 16000 bytes. I don't know
whether this makes FOLDRXXX superfluous. Maybe Allan Pratt can comment
on that.

This is correct, but the way the proof is written is not easy to understand. I
give below another proof.

For n>0 let

T(n) = x^a(n)/n^3	and 	U(n) = T(3n) + T(3n+1) + T(3n+2)

and for k>=0 let

Z(k) = sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} T(n)

We have

Z(k+1)	= sum {n=3^(k+1) to 3^(k+2)-1} T(n)
	= sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} [T(3n) + T(3n+1) + T(3n+2)]
	= sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} U(n)

Let us compare U(n) to T(n). We have a(3n)=a(n)+1 and a(3n+1)=a(3n+2)=a(n).
Thus

U(n) = x^[a(n)+1]/(3n)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+1)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+2)^3

and so U(n) has as upper bound

x^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/27

and as lower bound

x^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n+2)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/(3+2/n)^3

in other words U(n) = T(n) * (x+2)/(27+e(n)), where e(n)<(3+2/n)^3-27 tends to
0 when n tends to infinity. It follows then that

Z(k+1)= Z(k)*(x+2)/(27+f(k))

where f(k)<(3+2/3^k)^3-27 tends to 0 for n tending to infinity.

Now the series is the sum of all Z(k). Thus for x>25 we have Z(k+1)>Z(k) for k
large enough, and the series diverges; for x<25 we have Z(k+1)< r * Z(k) (with
r=(x+2)/27<1) for every k, and the series converges. For x=25 the series
diverges too (I think so), because Z(k+1)/Z(k) tends to 1 for k tending to
infinity.

We recently acquired some Western Digital EtherCard PLUS cards for IBM PC's.
We were planning to write MINIX drivers for them and we wanted the hardware
documentation from the supplier. We were indeed promised that.
However, as one might expect, we only got the documentation that stated
where to plug in the cable, and we are more interested in which IO-ports there
are, and what they do. Our supplier is not very helpful at the moment.

We will continue to nag our supplier, but in the meantime, does anyone have
the hardware info on this board?
We know there is a NatSemi DP8390 on there, and we have the datasheet on that
one, but there should also be an Ethernet Address Rom, plus some other things
on the board.

As they say, thanks in advance.

If you want dump to read the output from e.g. yes(1)
then you'll have to use a pty(4).

You should arrange that this pty is the control terminal of the
dump program and then write (redirect) the output of yes(1) to the pty.

Setting the control terminal of dump is done by writing a program which:

A) Removes the association with its control terminal by:

   ioctl(f, TIOCNOTTY, 0);

B) Opens the pty.

C) Exec's the dump program.

The above applies to Berkeley Unix 4.X

That reminds me to the goold old days, when PDP-11's ran only RSX,
RT-11 or RSTS. Sysmac.sml is a macro library, which contains the definitions
for the RT-11 "Programmed Requests" (nowadays known as system calls).

Here's the makefile that I used to get Nethack up under MSC 4.0... NB: the
CFLAGS macro and the link command.  I was able to play a couple of levels
without stack errors or hangups, however there are some problems,
(everything seems to be identified, inventory not displayed correctly,
color not quite right (but overall it works)) so i did not "install" it.

This is a bit of a flame, which I hope does not upset some people
too much. I have tried sending the comments privately, but have had
no reply.
I got a Kinetics internal Ethernet interface for a Mac SE, plus the
ethernet driver, test software and NCSA telnet version 1.12.
In order to try out this software in a safe manner I created a mini-
-Ethernet with the Mac and an Ethernet monitor. Am I glad that I did
this!
The test software, when run, tends to throw out a large number of
broadcast packets in a very short space of time. Sometimes one can
control the frequency, other times not. At least one test threw out
about 200 broadcast packets in much less than one second. If I had
been on the real CERN Ethernet then a few hundred users would have
had to deal with these!
FLAME ON
When will people writing test software avoid the intensive use of
broadcast packets? Multicast would be slightly better, but even then
the software should establish the address of those other computers
with which it can run a test, and then address them directly.
FLAME OFF (for a while)
I then tried to run NCSA telnet. This also started out with about
70 immediate broadcasts. These started out with a set of three
types of broadcast:
  1. arp with source ip address 0.0.0.255, looking for 0.0.0.127
  2. something with type field 80f3 (what the hell is this?)
  3. some other arp-type (type field 809b) with sender as 0.0.0.127
These three are repeated about 20 times at intervals of about
10 milliseconds (yes, milliseconds!). There are then a few more type
809b broadcasts at reasonable (a few hundred milliseconds!) intervals
before telnet starts to arp for the real host that I asked for.
FLAME ON
Why does software often insist on repeating packets at very short
intervals on vey reliable LANs (and have you seen the Sun lately!)?
FLAME OFF
Despite all the above, I waited for a quiet moment before connecting
onto the real Ethernet. I then tried telnet to our Ultrix Vax.
Immediate remark: keyboard in application mode does not work for us.
I then thought to run the vt100 test program (which some of you might
also have picked up off usenet). What a disaster: the emulation fails
all over the place!
Never mind, let us see if I can connect to our IBM VM system. Of course,
I have to go via a Spartacus KNET, because there is no NCSA tn3270
(is anyone working on this?). Complete failure: Spartacus has a bit of
a peculiar telnet setup (though Ultrix, bsd4.2 and FTP Inc. telnet on
a PC work fine) which seems to screw NCSA telnet.
Final try: go through an IBM 7171 front-end, which has 3270 to VT100
built in. Sort of works (using ESC n for PF key n), but since the
application keypad mode fails there is no way that I could get PA2
for clear screen. Merde (which the French will understand.
FLAME ON
I know that NCSA is now at version 2.0. Why did I get version 1.12
from Kinetics? (and why must only a Kinetics agent modify their Mac SCSI
box for a European power supply?). How do I get an updated version
quickly (no, I cannot do anonymous FTP!). Why have these simple tests
never been reported before? etc. etc.
FLAME OFF
I would be delighted if someone could tell me that all the above problems
are fixed in the current release!

I've neither encountered that bug, nor did I first get the key. There's a lot

Same problem here. I noticed that strange Find bug too. My
solution is a real kludge, but it works.

Instead of issuing the FIND command in script, TYPE the FIND command
with all the arguments into the message box and then (again
from script) add a return. Like:

on mouseUp
   type "FIND" && quote & key & quote && "in background field id" && number &
   return
end mouseUp

This also makes the repeated FIND easier.

I made a stack that needed a search option on partial keys. So I wanted
HC to keep on looking when the user stated that the item found wasn't
the right one.

I made a script to do this (if interested I can mail/post it) that
expects a second field for every field to be looked in. The item found
is put in the second field (named something like showName). When
the user says he wants to keep on searching, the next item found is
compared to the contents of showName. If it's the same, my script
says that 'it's all there is'. And cancels the search. Otherwise
a repeated search would be impossible.

If you like I can upload the lot. To comp.sys.mac.hypercard maybe?

To Apple:
Why do you reply to all the easy answers in comp.sys.mac.hypercard
bu happily skip all the possibly difficult ones? Seems like
the HyperCard group chooses the easy way out. Too many bugs in HC
perhaps?

I moved to TMON mainly because it does not affect the speed of my Mac.

I hope none of the Byte or MacTutor benchmarks were run under MacsBug.

Still, ES works better in MacsBug than it does in TMON.

I seem to recall having seen a statement like "since <one of
those sub-classes  -  I forget which> has no prime requisite,
you can't switch to/from it." The implication being that any of
the sub-classes that require more than one minimum is out as
regards dual-class characters. So you could be a "fighter-turned-
magician" but not a "ranger-turned-magician". I think it was in
one of THE BOOKS, but I'm not certain. One thing you could do
is to require 15 or 17 in ALL the requisites with minimums.
That will restrict the number of assasin/illusionists!!!

Consider the following variant of Maxwell's daemon:

You have the following two items:
    1) a metal block,
    2) a bowl with a liquid.
Both items have the same temperature and are placed close together, they
may, however, be thermally isolated from one another.

Now into the bowl you drop a very small magnet. The motion of the
molecules in the liquid will cause the magnet to move slightly. This
will induce a (very small) current in the metal block. This current will
cause the temperature of the metal block to rise. The current will also
try to stop the movements of the magnet; this will in turn slow down the
motion of the molecules, and the liquid will cool.

The result: The metal block will grow warmer and warmer, and the liquid
will grow colder and colder.

This contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, and has the "advantage"
over Maxwell's daemon that no intelligence is involved.

What is wrong with the above argument?

So he is the one being guilty to it all. Grr. You see, in Sweden 
"progressive" music had nothing to do with the music. When we speak -
or spoke at that time - of "progressive" groups, we talked of groups
that played quite regular rock or pop. There were just one difference
to the ordinary hit music, the lyrics. They were naive, trivial and 
uttermost boring political texts of a communistic nature. (Which does
not imply that they were paid by KGB or something.) I must admit I 
didn't listen to much to them, their proganda was too much for me.

Now, this kind of people dominated this non-profit companies that Bjorn
talked of. For them ideological purity was much more important than
interesting than good music. Not to be denied, *some* good music was 
actually released on Silence and MNW (the other big non-profit), but 
also a lot of true crap. And I can easily imagine that groups with
interesting music was refused beacuse they voted with the wrong party.
(They would never have released Yes, that are right wing if anything.)

Finally, I should admit that despite the poorness of Silence, they
had the most interesting music in Sweden at that time. But that more
gives an indication of bad the rest was. (Abba, do you remember?)

The lastest version of GEMBOOT which was distributed something like
half a year ago, allows you to set the location of the sole undocumented

without problems on one of the first Mega's that arrived in Switzerland
after changing the GEMBOOT startup file.

Hmmmm, as Landon Dyer once said (a long time ago) FOLDRXXX does NOT fix
the other problem with GEMDOS management of the internal directory
list (mutiple bad copies of the same block), GEMBOOT does provide
a workaround  for this problem (so I wouldn't trust FOLDRXXX) plus
a lot of other nice things.

Something else to watch out for. The recently concluded
series "Knights of God" on independant television was
notable only for having Gareth Thomas (Blake himself) playing
the part of the leader of a band of rebels trying to
overthrow the harsh Goverment sometime in the future UK.
Almost a reprise of his part as blake, but he isn't even
one of the major characters. His name comes about eighth
on the credits.

Now we know what he was doing while he was missing from
Blake's Seven. :->

Also look out for the second Dr Who, Patrick Troughton, in a
supporting role.

Note: I do Not recommend this series for any other reson
than the above mentioned curiosity value.

ML gives you objects with modifiable state, so that you don't need to
pass a state structure around with you. The disadvantage, of course, is
that you smash the applicative behaviour of the language -
whether it's worth it depends what you're trying to do.
   Another way around this is to use type abstraction. That way, your
state structure is an abstract object with a few access functions to get
at the bits you need. I've always used the former approach, so I don't know
how far the latter approach gets you. It's quite possible to take non-
applicative features like assignment and abstract over them to build
structured objects with varying state, a la Smalltalk perhaps. This isn't
"dirty" functional programming - it's just using a functional language as if
it were a language of a different kind. I recently dedicated a lecture to the
structured use of side-effects in ML.
   By the way, I have various little typecheckers and interpreters for tiny
functional languages lying around on-line somewhere, if you're interested.
All written in ML, of course.

I recently read a report from a British music journalist visiting Roland in
Japan. Apparently (but *don't* quote me on this :-)) Roland are working on
a rack-mount box with the same sorts of features as the MT-32 but aimed a
bit more at the Pro market - presumably related to the MT-32 as the TX81Z is

I have implemented, as an extension to the "VT100" option, some extra
code to allow uEmacs to recognise the top, left and right function keys
on Sun 3 consoles.  ( I imagine they will work on Sun 2s as well). 

These keys, except for the cursor keys (R8,R10,R12 & R14), return a
string of the form <ESC>[ followed by 3 digits followed by 'z'.  By
interpreting the digits as an integer, and subtracting 128 to get a
character, all the function keys can be made to simulate 'FN?' keys. 
Which they return depends on how the Sun keyboard is set up (with
setkeys(1)). 

They won't work if you use Sun-windows and have a .ttyswrc file.

Anyway - Here are the diffs:

Having observed chat about the American Max series and comparisons with the
UK series, I would like to point out that we (in the
UK) have only seen the Pilot in
terms of an action/adventure episode. Our Max series have really featured
Max as a video DJ, and later as a talk show host.

So, I have kept silent till now, but I reckon the action/adventure series
you guys in the US of A are discussing must be worth watching! Anyone care
to hazard a guess as to why we in the UK don't get your Max show; and
do you get ours?

About ten years ago I got a second hand copy of "UFO 1: Flesh Hunters" by
Robert Miall. It is a Warner Paperback Library edition, printed with 
permission from Pan books (who presumably did the UK edition). I have't seen
any since then.
How many of these UFO novels were there?
Did Robert Miall write anything else?

Well, several other forms of explanation, I guess.  This one confused me,
and I *understand* the address of an array. (Just teasing)

To put it another way....

Any object, of any type (integer, structure, array, etc.), has an address.
Usually, if it is an object that occupies several words of memory, it is the
address at which it begins. (Compiler theorists may be itching to tell me it
might mean something else entirely; let's keep this simple.)  The address of
an object is the compiler's handle for manipulating it.   You think of an
object by its name; the compiler "thinks" of it by its address.

The "address of an array" is the address that the compiler uses to access
that array and to calculate the position of any element in the array.

In C,  the address of an array is the same as the address of its first
element (array[0]).  If you want to set up a pointer to the array, you
get its address simply by naming it. Hence:

	pa = array;	/* pa now contains the address of "array" */

which is exactly the same as

	pa = &array[0]; /* "&" means "address of", so pa contains the
				address of element [0] of "array" */

Now this is a slight quirk in C - the name of the array being a synonym for
its address;  for any other object (notably a struct) that is not true.  If
you want the address of a structure you must write

	ps = &mystruct;	/* NOT ps = mystruct */

So we get back to the discussion from whence we came: why can't we be
consistent and get the address of an array by

	pa = &array;	?

To which the answer is:  you can, with some compilers.

I think I found a bug in BASIC-PLUS of RSTS V8.0. The following program
isn't working in the right way. I tried to read some records from a file
and to store them in an array. But after I read and stored all records,
the array was completely empty.

> 10 ON ERROR GOTO 1000
> 15 DIM IN$(100%)
> 20 FIELD #1%, 3% as a$, 20% as i$, 15% as q$

> 110 GOTO 32767
> 1000 IF ERR = 11 THEN RESUME 90
> 1010 ON ERROR GOTO 0
> 32767 END

The outputs in line 75 are alright, but those in line 100 aren't.
Only blank lines appear there.

I found out that if you change line 70 to 'IN$(Z%) = LEFT$(I$, 20%)'
- which does nearly nothing different - it works correctly.

Does anybody know a patch for this bug? Or does anybody know how to
avoid this in an other way?

Thanks in advance

Hold on, isn't this statement a bit too strong? The answer to which method
should be used ultimately depends on what the purpose of the estimations
is. 

In fact, if the purpose is to estimate y for a given x, then ordinary
least squares will do. In this case one is not really interested in
getting the best estimates of the parameters but only in getting a good
prediction.

I claim that there are very few regression examples where one really
cares whether or not the parameters are biased. In the large majority of
cases one is much more interested in the goodness of prediction. In this
case, one is interested in E[Y|X]. So if we model this quantity as
linear in X, then the OLS estimates are BLUE. This will also give
variances etc, all valid conditionally on X.

It is my feeling that a lot of books overemphasize the so-called bias,
since that is very often totally irrelevant.  For example, some
textbooks talk about biased parameter estimates when some variables
are missing in a multiple regression. In reality OLS is estimating a
better set of parameters than would the corresponding "unbiased"
estimator (OLS in this case will give an unbiased estimate of the best
surface based on the reduced set of variables). Certainly in this case,
one can make a strong argument that all the talk about biasses is
totally irrelevant.

Of course if the true purpose is to estimate parameters, e.g. to assess
the effect of a change in X on Y, then indeed one needs to worry a bit
about the effects of X being random.

There are, as you've guessed several papers in computational geometry
on line segment intersections.  You may look at the books by Shamos
and Preparata, and also the book by Edelsbrunner for references.

My favorite method to solve your problem though is an excellent
method invented by Randolph Franklin at RPI.  It is called ''adaptive
grid'' and works as follows.  First you overlay a regular, say G by G
integer grid on your scene.  Then you enter your edges into respective
cells of the grid  (similar to the bucketing idea!)  Then you make a pass
thru all the cells and find the intersections in each cell.  If an
intersection falls on a grid cell boundary you should be careful to
treat it so the integrity is kept intact.

I'm not very good in describing things in a hurry (especially Email)
but let me tell that I've wide experience with this stuff and it works
very well.  It is especially excellent for a scene made of short edges
with a rather homogeneous distribution.  Write me for details.
Also you may try Franklin at franklin@csv.rpi.edu.  Here is a short bibl.

Uhm, yes, unfortunately I find the 'feature' quite unusable.
I *never* come up with the correct sequence of == and @@, so I have to type
the command three times before I get it right. (really retype, that is.
'History mechanism' is something primos has never heard about).

I definitely prefer
for i in *.[ch]; do
    diff old/$i $i >$i.diff
done

(and you can add an 'if [ -d $i ]' if you really care about directories
ending in .c or .h. I don't, because I don't *have* directories ending
in .c or .h).

And, to continue some gripes on primos wildcards:
- I would expect them to work *always*. I.e. if I do
  TYPE @@
  (TYPE is primos echo) I would expect a list of all files, *not* '@@'.
- If I want all arguments on one line, and I use [WILD @@.TMP], and the
  result doesn't fit in 80 characters, I DO DEFINITELY NOT WANT IT TO TRUNCATE
  IT AT EIGHTY CHARS! I lost an important file that way: it was trying
  to generate a list containing PRECIOUSFILE.TMP, but, unfortunately,
  the .TMP started at position 81. So, it removed PRECIOUSFILE in stead.
  sigh.
  
Sorry, there are some neat ideas in primos, but the command processor and
it's wildcards is definitely *not* one of them.

Hi everybody !

I'm a final year student at Edinburgh University and as part of my final
year project I am using NeWS to build up a document composition system.
Alas, I'm new to NeWS and the NeWS manual does seem to be rather sketchy,
especially when it comes to using the CPS interface.

Having had a look at the stuff that is floating around in this newsgroup
I think that someone out there will be able to help me.

Point 1 : How can I control the litewin.ps and litemenu.ps packages through
          the CPS interface - especially, how do I get notification to the
          C program that something is happening ?

Point 2 : This may be trivial, but when I create an overlay for the purposes
          of rubber-banding, using the getclick family of operators, I can

If you try to force feed MINIX from an Ethernet at 10 Mbps it will probably
drop stuff.  There is undoubtedly a limit on how many interrupts per second
it can handle, but an AT it should be over 1000 per second.

The original tty driver was very carefully written to deal with exactly
this issue.  When characters come in, they are buffered, even if it is
not possible to send a message to the tty task.  This code is on lines
3528 to 3552 of the book.  Assuming you are still using this mechanism,
you ought to be able to accept characters at say 2400 baud without losing
any.

I talked to P-H yesterday.  Version 1.2 of MINIX in 256K & 640K PC, 512K AT, 
mag tape, and the IBM slipcase version with the abridged book are all
in stock.  If it is of any consolation to the people who have had to wait
and wait and wait, one of the corporate vice presidents was so unhappy
about the poor service to customers that he fired the person who was in charge
of managing the MINIX inventory.  He has been replaced by someone else who has 
clear instructions to make sure it doesn't go out of stock again.  They are now
shipping to everyone whose order got backlogged.

work it doesn't return allocated memory when you resize to a smaller amount

Here is a self-replicating Pascal program I wrote a few years ago.
The program looks dirty but it works !

program self (output);                                     
var i,j: integer;                                          
    a: array[1..8] of packed array[1..59] of char; begin   
  a[1] := 'program self (output);                                     ';
  a[2] := 'var i,j: integer;                                          ';
  a[3] := '    a: array[1..8] of packed array[1..59] of char; begin   ';
  a[4] := 'for i := 1 to 3 do writeln(a[i]);                          ';
  a[5] := 'for i := 1 to 8 do begin write(''  a['',i:0,''] := '',chr(39));';
  a[6] := 'for j := 1 to 59 do begin write(a[i][j]);if a[i][j]=chr(39)';
  a[7] := 'then write(a[i][j]) end; writeln(chr(39),'';'') end;         ';
  a[8] := 'for i := 4 to 8 do writeln(a[i]) end.                      ';
for i := 1 to 3 do writeln(a[i]);                          
for i := 1 to 8 do begin write('  a[',i:0,'] := ',chr(39));
for j := 1 to 59 do begin write(a[i][j]);if a[i][j]=chr(39)
then write(a[i][j]) end; writeln(chr(39),';') end;         
for i := 4 to 8 do writeln(a[i]) end.

You could the same thing without changing your AUTOEXEC.BAT. With the solution
presented above you will execute the same second version of AUTOEXEC.BAT each
time you reboot your machine (perhaps that's really what you want, but my
imagination doesn't go that far. If so, just disregard this article).

My solution: In the startup file you include the following:

if exist <filename_like_gaga.gag_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it> goto second
<here included all the stuff you want executed when booted for the first time>
echo gaga > <filename_like_gaga.gag_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it>
:second
<now follows the rest of the story (i.e. your autoexec.ddd)>

That's it. If you want to toggle between the two boot modes just add a line
like:

del <filename_like_gaga.gag_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it>


		I hope this will help anybody :-)

Help wanted: how to create text in Hercules graphic mode?
 
I have a program written in MSC (parts coded with MASM) which does
quite nice things with grapichs but suffers lack of characters.
According to my knowledge the only way to get characters in Herc graphic
mode is to draw them on screen by lightning a set of pixels, right?
 
Somebody *must* have written a program which draws characters and
other symbols, so please help me.  C and/or ASM sources and/or ideas
will be *very* appreciated.

 I'm thinking of getting one of those new sampled pianos and would like
to get som info. From the net and from my own experience in my local
piano store, I've understood that the Yamaha Clavinova CLP 300 is
a pretty good choise. But I seem to remember a rumor about something
called Yamaha pf85 wich would be some kind of stageversion of the CLP 300.
Has anyone seen it, played it, compared it with the CLP 300? What are the
differences in price, sound, keyboard?

My local pianopusher here in Sweden hadn't heard of it. Is this because
it is so new or because it is a local phenomenon in the states?

>From looking at the BSD4.3 sources I found out the following:
When a tty is opened the associated process group is set to
that of the creator. The signals that the tty driver generate (e.g. caused
by ^C) are sent to this process group.

However, for sockets (a pipe is implemented as a pair of sockets in BSD4.3
and maybe elsewhere!) the associated process group is not set automatically.

So what you have to do is to set it before you can get ant SIGIO's! Use
   int pgrp = getpid();
   if (fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, pgrp) == -1) {
	perror("fnctl");
	exit(1);
   }
or
       ioctl(fd, SIOCSPGRP, &pgrp)	/* note: & */

I think this should work even if pipes aren't implemented as a pair of
sockets, but I haven't tried any of it.

See select(2). (Just a detail: select will tell you that there is data
to read if there actually is data to read or if the other end(s) have
closed the pipe. In the latter case read() will return an EOF - this
stuff caused me some trouble before I read the *real* documentation -
the OS source code!!)

Agree,but how about these:

Muffin Man (Frank Zappa)              (I think FZ was the most underrated)
Son of Mr. Green Genes (Frank Zappa)  (guitarist there ever has been.But,)
Son of Orange County (Frank Zappa)    (he can't play anymore,too bad.    )
Push Comes To Show (Van Halen) Eddie Van Halen
Crossroads (Cream) Eric Clapton (The 2nd solo,of course)
Astronomy (Blue \yster Cult) Donald Roeser (on "Some Enchanted Evening")
Lazy (Deep Purple) Ritchie Blackmore
Fat Time (Miles Davis) Mike Stern

I know that when I get home I will kill myself for not adding more solos,
but these are the ones I can think of without looking at my records.
But maybe that's a good sign indicating that these are really my favourites.

I'd be very glad to see some reactions on the list.

Hello. I've been wondering how to get a little extra memory for my
Macintosh Plus (needed in these days of Hypercard and Multifinder).

I was wondering if the normal brute-force method could be used;
  Just solder 1M memory chips on top of the existing one (piggyback)
  and attach CS (chip-select) and whatever else is needed from the
  adressbus to select the appropiate chip. I haven't really checked
  out the memorychips but maybe an inverter is needed for some signals.

  If I'm correctly informed there are 22 bit defining the adress on
  a MC68000, making it possible to have 4M of memory.

*If* this is possibly, would programs take advantage of it?

Well, maybe this is one of the most stupid questions asked to USENET
since it all began and if so - please forgive my ignorance...

You are not trying to say that the US are German-mythological qua
religion, are you? :-)

No, but seriously: what does that tree have to do with Christianity?
(Or, what does the mean US Christmas have to do with it at all - but
that's another story)
Is Santa Claus Christian? The Easter Bunny and its eggs?

While I agree that the dates of these festivities originally come from
the church, the things which are generally celebrated have no origin in
Christian doctrine, and no one pretends so.

Sorry if I offended anyone by this - I am not commenting on those who do
use those times for prayer and as memorial days.

Yes.  I'm using uw4.1 on an SE with System 4.1/Finder 6.0 and a beta version 
of MF (1.0b6).  (As an aside, we can't get System Tools 5.0 in the UK until 
early next year, unless you know different to me !)

UW runs but I do character losses at 9600 baud.  I can't work out why, and
I'm not convinced its UW's fault.  I wrote to John Bruner, the author, who
says other people were reporting the same problem.

Richard, The bug is not in the slightest bit fundamental and could be fixed
in less than 1 day once and for all.  I have done it for a ANSI unix-like I/O
library:
Merely separate the _cnt field
of struct FILE into a _icnt and an _ocnt, change getc/putc to use _icnt/_ocnt.
Fix _filbuf/_flsbuf to use the right one, and to whinge when _icnt/_ocnt
goes -ve when you expect the other one to.
This for free also enables the library to police the "fflush/fseek between
change of direction for I/O" restriction and avoids chaos there.

   Is there anybody out there who has info about whether the Chinese
government has changed the policy regarding students aboard and how
it is changed, because from this April, all students sent by the
government are asked to sign contracts between him/her and his/her
institution.

   What do these contracts mean ?  Does this imply that those who came
out before this April (thus did not sign) then have a somewhat different
status (for example, can not be asked to go back to carry out a certain
contract) ?

   E-mail to me and I'll summurize OR post to the newsgroup.  I believe
there are other people who are also interested in this issue.

The eye can see colours (for example, in afterimages) that cannot be

In "vector.h 1.3" the following definition of the X(X&) constructor

You should add the indicated line in order to set the size of

There was a show on sometime between the late 70's and early 80's (1 season).
And I can't remember the name.  It was actually two (or more) shows in one
with each sub-show taking a fraction of the time slot.  One part was a 
modern day dracula.  Another dealt with a society living underground.  They
couldn't come up to the surface without special filters due to dust/pollution
or some such.  Ring any bells?  It was NBC, I think.

The answer to both questions is yes.  The Free Software Foundation (you
know, the GNU Emacs people) will distribute (soon?) a modified version of
their C compiler which does C++.  Their debugger GDB (a dbx-lookalike) knows
how to handle it.

I haven't used either of these so I have no opinions to whether they are
in any way adequate.  Just passing useful information along.

I can do it using either /bin/sh or csh, but it does require more

risking a few error messages to the terminal.

I have only the faintest interest in the ST stuff and I would prefer it
to be posted elsewhere, although I am not particularly bothered either.

I think the interesting question is: WHY DO WE HAVE DIFFERENT NEWSGROUPS??

I always thought it was to organize postings by subject and because different
people are interested in different things.

If you argue that ST postings could as well be made to rec.arts.sf-lovers
rather than to the special ST newsgroup, you could just as well argue
that we only need one newsgroup on the entire net: general.general.general.

it doesn't move left to the right place.

NCSA Telnet is really a must, but ...
on a Mac SE and a Mac II, NCSA Telnet 2.0 forces an american keyboard, in a
permanent manner (it remains after exiting telnet, until the next Macintosh
reboot). It is very painful when you use, for instance, a french keyboard:
not only you have to remember to type Q for A, and so on, but you cannot
type for example a Control-Z under telnet.
[On a Macintosh +, one do not loss its keyboard]

Is this bug fixed in the last version ?

I'm looking for a job in Computer Engineering to begin around July
1988. I'm getting my Master of Science in Computer Engineering June
1988 and at present holding a degree equal to BS in Electronic
Engineering. My BS studies have included:
	
	Computer hardware (hands-on knowledge with mc68k),
	Analog electronic 
	Control engineering (analog and digital control)

			      from programs) 
	Compiler construction (an expertsystem shell) 
	Program environment (for CCS programming) 
	Distributed operating systems (in UNIX)
 	Compiler mapping object-oriented language on parallel computers

Furthermore I do have experience in conventional programming (PASCAL,
C, postscript, UNIX (awk, shell-scripts(C-shell) and yacc/lex) (and Basic)),
functional programming (LISP and ML) and logical programming (Prolog)
and knowledge about object-oriented programming. And I have also attended 
courses in VLSI design, databases, etc. I have been working with CDC under 
NOS/Telex, VAX 11/750 under Ultrix, SUN 3 under Sun OS 4.3 (UNIX), MacIntosh 
(LISA) under Finder and IBM S36 under IBM property operating system.  

My spoken English is excellent and my written English is satisfactory,
good knowledge of the Scandinavian languages (Danish (of course),
Swedish and Norwegian), some speaking and reading knowledge of German
and limited knowledge of French and Spanish (and Latin). 

I have 5 years experience in group project work in engineering and
computer scinence areas, broad social interest, good health.

My interest include computer hardware and software, operating system
design, expertsystems, distributed, concurrency and teaching.

I'm open on location (outside Denmark) but I have relatives or other
reasons to be especially intereted in:

	Canada (British Colombia or Toronto)
	USA (New England or Pacific Coast)
	Pacific (New Zealand or Oceania)
	Thailand
	Scotland (Highlands)

I'll look forward to any reponds.

Did anyone ever get the m2pp program to work on Sun Modula-2?

Does anyone have a different Modula-2 pretty-printer (perhaps better)?

This is simply NOT TRUE. I am also working with MSC (version 4.0) and had only
one minor problem when I compiled MicroEmacs 3.9e (the latest version which
was posted on Usenet). This problem relates to the Subshell spawning. But if
you know just a little bit of C, there is no problem to fix it (add a routine
specific to MSC). Some time ago, there was even a posting in comp.sources.bugs
describing all the necessary steps to do that.

I am sure you enable breaking with ^C (either in config.sys or in autoexec.bat)
Turn this off, and all your problems have gone :-)
I know this is not the solution to this problem we all want to have. Perhaps
you can do it with signal(). If not you have to included a function of your own
which intercepts the break vector of MS-DOS.

(Character) file storage is simply more flexible.  The form in which
information is stored must be the most flexible possible, or you lose
information.  The D-crate's pitching of conditionals is simply the
manifestation of this.

Proponents of restrictive protocols for information storage really ask
"the world" to change to fit the protocol model.  In science, models
change to fit the data, not the other way round (unless you cheat).
To me, browbeating eventual non-conformists into "catching up" by
labeling the a model as "advanced" is just a form of negative
motivation.  All the lousy places I have ever worked ran on negative
motivation, none of the good ones.  If your model *is* really worth
using, and you can communicate its value, you will not need such
tactics. 

Interactively defined functions?  Haven't typed one in *years* -
that's what scratch buffers are for (in case I want to change a
*character* or two, or later save it.).

Any mouse-based gadgets you can point to in Interlisp can be recreated
for a text editor working on correctly parsed Lisp code.  May  take
execution time, but if this is prohibitive, your function is probably
too large.

Least-favourite-subject: domain theory



     Those interested in the issues surrounding the mechanics and
philosophy of fantasy worlds should read Tolkien's (non-fiction)
essay "On Fairy-Stories".  It appears in the collections _Tree and
Leaf_ and _The Tolkien Reader_.

     One of the main ideas behind it is that the fantasy author or
story-teller is a "sub-creator", who tries to create a "secondary
belief" (rather than exactly a "willing suspension of disbelief")
in the reader.  In the fantasy that works, the reader should be
able to enter the world every time she picks up the book, and not
be aware of the world as being constructed by the author.  This
involves not only internal consistency, but a lack of gimmickry.

     For instance, in _Lord of the Rings_ I was never aware of
anything being in the world gratuitously.  (Others may differ! :-))
In _The Sword of Sha-Na-Na_ (sic)(sick?), on the other hand, I was
very aware of the Elfstones as being just a gimmick to get the
characters out of tight spots.  Sure it was internally consistent
(the Elfstones only had any effect in times of direst need for
their holders), but the hand of the author was clearly visible.

     Similarly, applying it to FRPG's, the magic system in AD&D is
certainly internally consistent (to the extent that it is described),
but just doesn't "work" for me.  Having MU's able to remember several
copies of a spell, but forgetting it when the last copy is cast, is
obviously a gimmick to limit the number of spells an MU can use.

     So I guess the moral of all this for FRPG or module designers
is that it's best to start out with a few basic assumptions and build
up your world from them by fairly believable steps, and if you can't
avoid ending up with something really hairy, then change one of your
assumptions rather than put in quick kludges.  (Gee, sounds like
software engineering! :=))

1)  Does anyone, preferably in the UK or Europe, have a copy of the new
X toolkit interface definition I can get by ftp?

2)  I'm considering implementing the X toolkit in Standard ML.  Are there any
constraints on what I should include or exclude?  The documentation mentions
implementation in different languages, but doesn't say much about what this
means.  Is the idea to provide the same functions, with the same names and
functionality, in each language?  What about languages that have automatic
storage management or automatic creation of objects, etc?  How far can I
deviate from the documentation & still use the name "X Toolkit"?

3)  Is the toolkit definition limited to the intrinsics, or are toolkits
expected to provide a standard class hierarchy?

4)  Is there any relation between the InterViews toolkit, the Xr, Sx &
DEC toolkits provided with X version 10R4, and the current X toolkit?

5)  If I go ahead, my first implementation will be a prototype, on top of X
version 10R4.  This is because someone else is working on porting X version 11
to Standard ML, and I want a simple windowing system I can use fairly quickly.
I hope the prototype will make implementing a full version reasonably
straightforward.  I will probably ignore the resource manager, since I'll get
that for free when the full Xlib is implemented.  I'll also ignore colour for
the time being, and only implement devices (widgets) I'm immediately interested
in.  Is there anything else I can obviously ignore?

Some (possibly) timely information from a course entitled "The Art of

From one of the handouts :-

"Word processors: research has shown that when writers use pen and paper
 alone, their thoughts and information tend to have better planning and
 organisation. When using word processors alone, writers tend to plan
 on a more surface level, focussing on such aspects as word choice, sentence
 structure, and spelling"

It goes on to recommend starting with pen and paper and graduating to WP's
after the first draft has been written.

I trust that this may have been of some interest.

tege@nada.kth.se replied by e-mail to my original posting which asked
if it is always possible to append digits to a positive number in order
to make a prime. Unfortunately, his address is one of those I can't
reach, and so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone and post
another article.
  His argument is very simple, using the Prime Number Theorem to give
an approximation to the number of primes between x.10^n and
x.10^n+10^n-1 (which is the same problem I asked but translated to
mathematics) which shows that as n -> inf, this number of primes also
goes to infinity. A very simple argument that proves you can always
append digits to make any number into a prime. Great stuff.

I use Home Accountant Plus by Continental Software. The (legit.) version I use
was originally bundled with the Columbia MPC, so it had to be 'unprotected'
and altered to remove some hardware dependencies. (Incidentally, this made
it possible to compile it with QuickBasic - essential if you're impatient
like me!)

I've found it reasonably secure and well-featured.

I have a friend who is trying to transfer some files off of an Micromation
MP/M system.

He has so far moved the standard "Generic" CP/M Kermit (slowly) to the MP/M
machine but it doesn't seem to work correctly.

Has anybody ever managed to get Kermit to work under M/PM?  Is there a simple
set of differences between C/PM kermit and M/PM Kermit.  We have the full
source code for C/PM Kermit.

The HP840 is a RISC architecture machine.  Reduced instruction set implies
more instructions required to do the same job than on a 'complex'
instruction set machine, hence the proportionately larger executable files.
Presumably your 4.3BSD machine is a VAX-alike (i.e. complex instruction set).

The only other file from your list which exists on our HP840 system is
the C compiler, and look at the size of that beast!!

This should perhaps belong in comp.arch

It would appear that most 8088,8086,186 and 286 systems are
limited by the number of cycles taken to execute instructions
(I.E the clock speed).  However the 80386 (at 16 and esp at 20 Mhz)
is limited by its memory bus bandwidth.  That is the memory subsystem
on most 286 boxes is fast enough have little or no real effect on
performance compared to a change in clock speed.   An 80386
however is largly limited by the rate that it can be 'fed' data
and instructions.   

16 Bit memory subsystems have a devestating effect on the 80386 
for 2 reasons.  Firstly 2 memory accesses are required rather than
one thus doubling the access time.  Secondly most 16 bit memory cards
are designed for 8 or 10 Mhz operation not 16 Mhz so a significant
number of wait states are needed when used with a 386.   It would
appear that a 'cache miss' on the Intel Inboard(tm) generates beteween
10 and 12 wait states thus making access to 16 bit ram slower than
from the original 286.

In conclustion - if you want a 32 bit CPU use 32 bit ram.  If you
just want the instruction set use the P9 (80388) - if it ever appears.

(This posting written on a Dell 386 with 6 MB of 0 wait static 32 bit ram)

I didn't know of the CTRL-SHIFT-ALT trick, but I had a problem similar
to yours: there was no way my Mega would boot from floppy, and that
turned out to be quite a problem when a desk accessory I had downloded
from somewhere was turned unusable because of line noise.  My "solution"
was not to boot from hard disk at all, which I now find better since it
allows me to choose different configurations (desk accesories and such)
depending on the job I'm going to do.

I'm also interested on this question, and it has been already asked a couple
of times with no visible answer.  I've never used the old ROMs, so I don't
know what the infamous "40 folder limit" means. I've had more than 40 folders
on my hard disk and nothing happened.  Does this mean that the problem is
fixed? Or is it 40 folders DEEP?

I've been re-reading recently Feynman's excellent volumes and enjoying
myself.  The question is:  Are there physics books of similar style?
One thing that I like about Feynman is that he tries to ``demystify''
stuff instead of giving cookbook formulas.  Since I do this as a
leisurely activity, the absence of too many formulas and long
mathematical analyses (at least in Vol. I) are also appreciated.
I'm especially interested in classical mechanics.  Philosophical
implications of physics laws such as causality, etc. are also interesting.

Send me individual replies and I'll post a summary to the net. Thanks!

The story I've heard is that this is not a bug.  Rather (as warned in the
manual) the other characters you meet are also poking around, and can have
effects even while they are not in the same location as you.

In particular, as I've heard it, if the adventurer gets to the pedestal before
you do then he will take the key.  (And allegedly you then can recover it when
you kill him.)  I haven't tried this line of play yet, so can't vouch for it,
but it sounds plausible.

There's a cute bug in the ST version, though, to do with the pedestal.  If
you move the pedestal and then type 'take all' you end up carrying the pedestal,
a duplicate of which remains in place.  (If you just try to 'take pedestal',
you are told that it is too heavy to lift.)  I'm told that this results from
a bug in the relevant object definition table entry, so it might have propagated
to other versions.  (I'd doubt that the driving data undergoes as much analysis
as the executable code during porting to other machines.)

Hi,
   I have a problem with the Zorland C compiler, aka Datalight-C or
NorthWest-C which I wondered if any netlander had previously encountered
and solved.
   I have a program which works fine in small model but recently I had
to go to the data model (small code, large data) whereupon it hung my
XT clone. Tracing execution seems to indicate that the DOS software
interrupt routine INT86 may be the source of the trouble.
   Has anyone seen problems with INT86 in D or L model programs? The
prospect of DEBUGging the interface between C and assembler does not
appeal to me.
   BTW I have deliberately not given details of the program. I do not
       want to debug it on the net. Please e-mail me only if you have
       solid evidence of problems in the INT86 area.

      thanks for any help you can give,
           Andrew

The best set which I've found are the Wargames Research Group 1685 - 1850
rules. Although the time period sounds a bit long these rules have the
following advantages (My opinions only).

- Wide ranges of troops covered (You can fight outside Europe)
- Wide range of weapons covered (Pikes for those Moscow Militiamen etc)
- Simple solution for combat - This is what I really like, There@s
      No nonsense evaluating every 20th of a casualty, or evaluating
      grenadier companies firing separate from the rest of their battallion.
- All weapons are handled simply. Just a different entry in one table.
- Movement is alternate, not simultaneous, things move much quicker.
- Hand to hand combat is decided very quickly, (Just like reality).
- Morale tests are also quite fast to do, and give specific tests for
  different situations. (This avoids an old problem where eg Horsemen test
      morale before charging, Test fails horribly, Horsemen rout off the 
      field.) To make you go away, the opponent actually has to do
      something.
- European regulars have "National characteristics".
    ie British are disciplined infantry and rash cavalry.
       Russians are stoical Infantry (Won@t retreat easily)
       Spanish are easily panicked
       Highlanders charge aggressively
       French columns are impetuous and frighten the enemy.
       Austrian and Prussian cavalry are Bold
       Austrian, Spanish and Dutch Generals are Cautious.

Together with these rules I would recommend the army lists published by
Table Top Games.

These cover the European armies for most of the big campaigns of
1805-1815 and ensure a balanced army is selected (Although the 
1000 point armies don@t always work too well.
eg My russians need 12 Gun Artillery Batteries (6 pieces on the table)
   This leaves me few points for infantry or cavalry
   (In practice a Russian 1000 point army has two of Inf, Cav & Art)

The lists also help to enhance the National Flavour of an army
ie British get few Cavalry, but some veteran Infantry.
   French after 1812 have Raw Infantry or Guards.
   Austrians Have Very Large numbers Of infantry.

I can summarise some of the +/- points of each of the armies I've seen
if you mail me.

I'd recommend 15mm scale troops (Much cheaper and more transportable)
    They'll fit on your table too.

I actually use the 6mm scale which is cheaper, lighter and requires
about 60cm x 100 cm for a medium game.
However the Job of painting, mounting and moving the little guys is
much harder.

It was 1978.  Episode 1 of the first series was a pilot production for the
whole thing and as such is slightly different in flavour to the others.  The 
first series (6 episodes) covered the ground of the TV version and books 1
and 2.  Then came the Christmas (1978) show to make a link to the second
series which was broadcast in 1979 and consisted of 5 episodes.

> For my money, the show (and scripts) are MUCH funnier than the books.

True.  The radio shows left much more to the imagination with the assistance
of some very good sound effects.  I thought the TV series spoiled it.  For 
instance at the end of the first radio series you hear the song 'What a
Wonderful World' amid the sound of burning trees on prehistoric Earth; can't
you just imagine it?

There is a scanf in libsrc.a, but it is not included in libc.a.  You have to
compile it yourself with cc -LIB -c scanf.c and put in in the library.
It was omitted from libc.a because there was no room on that diskette!

Although X as distributed uses TCP/IP to connect clients and server, it
is possible use other network protocols by relatively small changes to
the lowest levels of library and server.  We have almost gotten the
server half of such a set-up running using Amoeba (a distributed
operating system with its own, capability-based RPC mechanism).
The library half should be working as soon as we solve problems with the
C compiler.

The question is, how much does this buy us?  Since Amoeba is not Unix, X
clients requiring advanced Unix features won't run under vanilla Amoeba.
What percentage of the available client applications will be convertable
to a different operating system, where, e.g., one will have <stdio.h>
available, but not select(2)?  I would assume that there will be VMS
support for X, so that one might expect clients to be OS-independent,
but then again, you can never know what hacks a performance-driven
application programmer may use... (including VAX assembly :-)

Can anybody comment on this?  It would also be interesting to know if
third-party software for X would come binary or source.

The five books are quite different in character. The second one
("The marriages between zones 3, 4 and 5") could possibly be called
"feminist SF" - it is very different from the other four in most ways.
The third ("The Sirian Experiments") is at times rather funny, and the
fifth ("The sentimental agents in the Volyen empire") is among the funniest
books I've read.

On the other hand, number 4 ("The making of the representative of planet 8")
was rather depressing. While reading it I thought that "it can't get any
worse than this". It could, of course. (I don't refer to the quality of the
book, but to the events in the story).

I should mention the title of the first one also: "Shikasta" This is
the most "important" of the five, in some sense. It is also the one that
could perhaps be called "stiff". All the books are well worth reading.

not binhex correctly (the Mac program).
Then the problem could be solved with a similiar program on unix-machines.
The problem seemed to show up when the file-names where extremely long
(28 might be the number).

It seemed not to be so sensitive about file-names.

Unfortunately I have lost the sources.

Today I read an posting from rhorn@infinet.UUCP about the problems
with the Ozone layer. So I got interested and now wanted more
information about it and the problems with the Ozone layer in
Switzerland present. I would like any information and I'll look
forward to any reponds.

Here is a little IconEditor I wrote.
This goodie works on Smalltalk 80 VI2.2 VM1.1
It comes in two parts.
The first part 'Icon menu.st' adds knowledge about icons to the 
StandardSystemController's blueButtonMenu.
You should file in this one first.
The second part 'Icon Editor.st' is the editor himself.

Some notes about icons:
The icon's textRectangle is clipped with the icon's boundingBox.
To cancel a given textRectangle simply move it outside the outlined box.
The method storeOn: in class OpaqueForm is buggy.
You should add enclosing round brackets to the output. Otherwise
you won't be able to read the saved icon definitions back.

You have defined DOGNAME but you are missing the dog's name :-)

Some TNC-2's have problems with the WA8DED software (version 2.1).
Most of the outgoing frames cannot be docoded by other stations because
the software turns off the transmitter before all bits have been transmitted.

There are two solutions to this problem:

Hardware: connect a small (~2.2uf) capacitor from the base of the PTT keying
          transistor to ground. (Note: you may have to increase TXDELAY)

Software: the code that turns off the transmitter starts at location $037B
          (3E 05...). It's possible to insert a short delay loop, so that the
          transmitter remains keyed for a few milliseconds longer.
          (I haven't tried this yet.)


73s, Walter  dg2kk@dg2kk.UUCP


PS: Does anyone know if WA8DED is on USENET/Bitnet/ARPANET/anynet???
    What is his email address? Please let me know.  Thanks.

I am using Venix for several years now and have the folowing comments.

1. it IS System V UNIX.

2. It has a faster 'feel' for the interactive user than Xenix or Microport

3. It seems to be bug free. This system is running news and I am doing most
   of the development on it. I have had no problems for at least a year now,
   and the system is on the air 24 hours a day.

   A few times I had to remove the -O options when compiling, but same
   counts for 3B2 UNIX.

4. Venturecom claims it to be REAL TIME. I have no experience with
   REAL real-time on this system, and don't know if the venix system calls
   are interruptable.

We found the following bug in sushperm.c of the sush distribution:

In routine addgroup the pointer gpmem was incremented before it was used.
So, the first member of the group was never found, and the reference to
the last member lead to an illegal memory reference (NULL pointer!).

original code:

	 gpmem = gpt->gr_mem;
	 while(*gpmem++) {  <------------------gpmem is incremented
		 if(!strcmp(user,*gpmem))  <---gpmem is used
			 ok++;
	 }

	 /* auth failed - return */

corrected code:

	 gpmem = gpt->gr_mem;
	 while(*gpmem) {
		 if(!strcmp(user,*gpmem++))
			 ok++;
	 }

	 /* auth failed - return */

Froese's best guitar solo, by most accounts, is on Cloudburst Flight
on the Force Majeure album, back in '79. He starts with slow chords
and fingering on a 12 string acoustic, then some "power chords" (!) on
the 12 string, and then onto the electric (Fender Strat I think).
Some of the recent live work's been good, as well - Franke holding down
a rhythm, with Froese and Haslinger both firing off screaming guitar riffs.

I am sending this letter out to the network to ask for solutions to a
particular problem of Bayesian Inference. Below is the text of the
problem, and at the end is the mathematical statement of the information
given. Simply, I am asking the questions:

1) Can you find bounds on the final result. If so, how?
2) If not, why is it not possible to do so? 
   What is missing in the specification of the problem?
3) If you get nowhere with this problem, would you be able to solve it
   if you were given the information: p(pv|t or l)=0.9?

I am interested in the problem of providing probability bounds for events
specified in a Bayesian setting when not all the necessary conditional 
probabilities are provided in setting up the problem. 

PROBLEM
~~~~~~~
(A problem relevant to the handling of Uncertainty in Expert Systems.)
We want to know the probability of a patient having both lung cancer and
tuberculosis based on the fact that this person has had a positive reading
in a chest X-ray. We are given the following pieces of information:

1. The probability that a person with lung cancer will have a positive
   chest X-ray is 0.9.

2. The probability that a person with tuberculosis will have a positive
   chest X-ray is 0.95.

3. The probability that a person with neither lung cancer nor tuberculosis
   will have a positive chest X-ray is 0.07.

4. In the town of interest, 4 percent of the population have lung cancer,
   and three percent have tuberculosis.

EVENTS
~~~~~~
l = lung cancer;       t = tuberculosis;           pv = positive chest X-ray

SETUP
~~~~~
In the statement of the problem below:-

~l means 'not l'.
~l, ~t means 'not l and not t'.
t or l means 't or l'
where 'not', 'and' , and 'or' are logical operators.
so that: p(~l, ~t) means probability( not l and not t).
Also,
p(pv|l) means the conditional probability of event pv, given event l.
PRIORS
~~~~~~
p(l) = 0.04;           p(t) = 0.03;                p(~l, ~t) = 0.95
CONDITIONALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
p(pv|l) = 0.9;         p(pv|t) = 0.95;             p(pv| ~t,~l) = 0.07

(You are not given p(pv| t or l) )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please mail all solutions or comments to me, and I will let interested parties 
know what the results are. 
(I will specially treasure attempts which don't use independence assumptions.)
Thanks in advance to anyone who will spend time on this problem...
Regards,
Tom Kane.

I assume you refer to the British Empire - prior to that, Britain (and before
the rest joined/were conquered by it, England) fought mostly against either
France, Spain or both at once. The wide domain of the English language is
directly due to the Empire, just as the wide use of Spanish throughout South
and Central America is due to the Spanish Empire.

Including the Arabs? :-)

There are a number of ancient submarine designs, including one which was a
rowing boat with a watertight cover! The first practical submarine was (I
believe) designed by a Mr. Holland, resident of Ireland, for use against the
Royal Navy. The Royal Navy took over the design, but regarded such concealed
warfare as ungentlemanly, and didn't make much use of them until Germany
showed the way.

The jet plane was invented practically at the same time by Britain, Germany
and the U.S.A. Germany had the first flying jet aircraft, followed closely by
Britain. Britain would have had a jet fighter not long after the Battle of
Britain except for government intervention. Fortunately, Hitler was equally
stupid. The Nazis believed they would win the war in a couple of months, and
gave little interest to projects which would bear no short term military
results. When they did get the world's first jet fighter (the Me262) it was
pretty devastating, albeit rare, until Hitler decided that it would make a
great fighter-bomber. Two bombs were fitted under the nose, at the expense
of two cannon and much speed and agility. Fortunately, Nazi policy was "if
it doesn't work, stomp on whoever says so." The first American jet was too
late for WW2, and the first Russian jet had a captured German engine.

Now, for those who say "Why is this in sci.space?", read the above and apply
the lessons of history to the shuttle, Hermes, HOTOL, or whatever craft your
country should be sponsoring.

It's "the Making Of The Representative From Planet 8", if I remember right.
This is from the announcements to a Radio 3 broadcast of Glass's new orchestral
piece "The Light" - a tone poem about the Michelson-Morley experiments.

Incidentally, it's not the first SF opera. I heard a broadcast in New Zealand
of a Swedish opera called "Aniara", based on an epic poem about a colonizer
spaceship on its way to oblivion. I can remember neither the poet's nor the
composer's name.

I've only read the first of Lessing's series and didn't like it much. I felt I
was being preached at (Lessing is a Sufi - I don't know whether her having
been born in Iran has anything to with that - and it shows in her more recent
writing). OK, the content of the sermon may not have been as obnoxious as
Heinlein, Tolkien or Pournelle, but it was still gratuitous in literary terms.

Readers in the UK, and those elsewhere with UK contacts, may like to know...

(1) W.H.Smiths are stocking Asimov's "Fantastic Voyage II" in hardback,
UKL10.95.

(2) An organisation called Channel 5 Video, available at least in W.H.Smiths
and Woolworths, produces tapes of UFO, Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet (under the
title "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons", Stingray (yuk), and, of course,
the Prisoner. Each tape that I have seen contains two episodes of the
appropriate program. All cost less than UKL10.
What proportion of the total output of these programmes is available I can't
say, except for the Prisoner (100%).

Warning for foreign readers:
These tapes are VHS-PAL. According to "Which?" they work in Australia,
New Zealand, Europe except France, South Africa, and the Middle East, but not
North America.

A whole bunch of questions:


Does anybody run multiple subnets on a single Ethernet?

    If so, do you use subnet broadcasts or net broadcasts?
    Do you find it worthwhile to use ethernet multicast for
    subnet broadcasts? How do you assign the multicast addresses?
    For what purposes do you still use net broadcast?

    Should redirects be provided by an inter-subnet gateway,
    when both subnets are on the same Ethernet?


What are the semantics of 'ICMP redirect to net' in a subnettted environment?


Does anybody run multiple classes of subnet on a single net?

    Does the mechanism proposed in rfc950 ( ICMP broadcasts to
    discover the subnet mask ) still work? Do you use it?


Thanks for your time

I have just added some extra memory to a Sun 3.  Unfortunately, it did
not increase the usable amount of virtual memory.  I have been informed
(not by Sun I hasten to add), that 4.x will only allocate memory up to
the disk swap space size.  Adding more memory will speed things up but will
not increase your total usable virtual memory size (this is achieved by
increasing the swap space).  I was also informed that system V does not
inforce this type of restriction.

Well, the history repeats once again. A new RISC chip is launched and peopels
expectations reaches new "high scores". A few years ago there was another risc
chip set brougth to the market, called the Clipper. This processors performence
was climed to sweep all competitors off the sceene. Often compared to the
DEC 8x00 computers. For this chip set the picture has cleared now. The perfor-
mence range is not much more than can be achived with a 16-20 Mhz 68020. The
most i have seen of the 33Mhz versions is one running at room temprature.
Intergraph is one of the companys who is still using the Clipper (They recently
bought the rights for the chip set from NS/Fairchild) . From what i recall they
throw out the NS32032 for the Clipper. Well they could have had 2-3 times the
clipper performance with the NS32532 today. And they called the buy a bargin !
It's not suprising that the MIPS 2000 gives most power/Mhz, The architecture has
evolved during many years, without a hard pressure from the marketing such as
'We must have it NOW!!!'. (John Mashey mayby has another opinion, only my guess)

SO: Why is everybody so suprised ????!

On our systems, a small cron script executes every night the following
command:

	find / -print > /dirfile

Finding a file somewhere can be done by grepping in the /dirfile.
Of course, the contents of /dirfile are not really up-to-date, but this is
just a minor drawback. "find" on the whole system (including mounted disks)
takes more than an hour, a grep in /dirfile much less than a minute.

MacScheme doesn't have enviroments (atleast my version doesn't).  It
would be straightforward to port SCOOPS if somebody first provides
environments.  The hacks provided with MacScheme distribution are not

No, subranges occupy the same amount of space as the type they are
a subrange of. E.g. 0..255 will occupy two bytes. You may use a
CHAR or a BYTE, and convert to and from CARDINAL everytime you need
to do some caluculations.

Well, maybe that i've overlooked something really important, but i don't
see the 54MB limit with the AmigaDOS.
About a yaer ago, when there was no mount command, somebody from CATS
posted a sample device driver that mounted itself. It set up a device
structure which described the layout of the device. This structure is
now documented in dos/filehandler.h. One field in this structure holds
the number of longwords per block of this device. This is always set
to 128, giving 512 Bytes per Block.
Now, if i set this to 256 (1024 Bytes per Block), i should be able to
increase the disk limit to 108MB.
Apparently, AmigaDOS supports larger blocksizes. Just have a look into
the AmigaDOS Manual from Bantam. All block-layouts are described relative
to a 'SIZE', nowhere is said that SIZE is fixed to 128 !

So where is the problem ??? (Please, send no flames, only facts !)

There was a lot of discussion about how to get rid of my calls to _cleanup
earlier.  Here is the solution that I finally adopted.    The following commands
should do the job.
  cc -c -LIB exit.c putc.c
  ar r /usr/lib/libc.a exit.c putc.c
  ar x /usr/lib/libc.a cleanup.s
  ar d /usr/lib/libc.a cleanup.s
  ar bfork.s /usr/lib/libc.a cleanup.s

This requires the new archiver posted a while back (for the b option).
It also assumes that putting cleanup before fork.s will include cleanup.s
after exit.s and putc.s (check this).

I've not been very successful in getting Goswell's Xps to preview documents.
The Postscript file generated from TeX DVI files by dvi2ps and from Ditroff
files by the Transcript psdit program both cause it to choke, although in
different ways.

Is anyone using Xps successfully for TeX or Ditroff previewing?  Is there some
trick?

One thing to remember is that the partition size for partition 1 is one
smaller than for partition 2.

Another possibility is that the MINIX fdisk and the DOS fdisk don't agree
on the meaning of the partition table.  If everyone would create their
partitions from lowest cylinder to highest there would be no ambiguity.
However, if the order in the partition table is different from the cylinder
order, there are at least three interpretations.
  1. Table slot 1 is partition 1
  2. Innermost cylinder is partition 1
  3. Outermost cylinder is partition 1
I believe that the combination of MINIX, DOS, XENIX and Microport together
exhaust the entire list of possibilities.  I don'know if this is related
to your problem (which I otherwise can't understand), but it is worth 
keeping in mind.

If people are noticing and mentioning about Yar's breasts, why not
also mention about Troi's low cut outfit!!  Why does it need to be
so low cut that it shows her crevice?  Who is she trying to impress?
Do you think that the women in the future, working with men, will be
trying to dress sexy?  If so, what about the men?  Why not let them
show off their body too to make things even?   I think that the
producers, or whoever is in charge of outfits, and character development 
is making a contemporary decision regarding the issue of how people 
will dress in the future.  I.e. he/she thinks that female will be 
trying to attract males' attention by bringing out her femininity, 
but not vice versa, which is the current social behavior.
Or, perhaps the producers are just being comformists with bunch of 
other tv shows + movie producers by keeping females attractive 
towards men...

What I need is information on how to find out if a VGA (or a PGA) adaptor

Also - can someone tell me how to obtain the current cursor position directly

The reason I can not use the INT10 function provided is that my program has

602, 609 and 642, 650 respectively. 

It's the following lines that causes the error:

600: int (*getbind(c))()
601:
602: int c;
603:
604: {

The compiler reports an error at line 602 with 'not an argument'. The
same thing happens at line 642;

639: int (*fncmatch(fname))()
640:
641:
642: int fname;
643:
644: {

Since my experiences aren't the very best i C sofar, I would like to
get some hints on what to do. Maybe Kim Kempf at Microware has the
answer for me. Feel free to overwelm me with hints. Until then (when I
recieve the hints...), CU all!

I was a bit puzzled by this too, since I didn't think my article so
brilliant that anyone would want to repost it eight times.  If anyone
finds out what happened, could they please send me mail?


We now return you to your regularly scheduled nonsense...

Well folks, I've reached to master warlord (lvl 17, ~550000 Exp). To
my great dis-something, I haven't found any ladder down to level 11.
Somewhere back in my human brain, I recall that I've read something
about how to further down in the dungeon. What do I do ?!. Please give
me a hint.

There was more to the 20th century reference than that, however.
Dr. Crusher made the point that, since they were only at the technology
level of ~20th century Earth, it was easy for the disease to get out of
control and spread over the planet.  The implication was that if they
were more advanced the disease would not have wiped out the entire world.
