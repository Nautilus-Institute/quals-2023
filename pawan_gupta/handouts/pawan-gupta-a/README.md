# Description on the scoreboard

Hello code monkeys! How can you buy larger and fancier houses without an assistant that generates high-quality, bug-free, and secure code for you?

Pawan Gupta is such a programming assistant! It follows your directions and helps you write perfect code, which ultimately brings you closer to your next fancy house!

But as a curious code monkey, you always want to understand every little pesky secret about Pawan Gupta, don't you?

Today, we are offering you limited access to Pawan Gupta. Find the flag that only Pawan Gupta knows!

A few notes:

- Pawan Gupta is powered by the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- Because there are so many code monkeys interacting with Pawan Gupta simultaneously, you only have limited access to Pawan. This means you and your team are heavily rate limited.
- Please test your prompt offline before trying it on Pawan Gupta. The handout should be useful.
- Keep in mind that responses from Pawan Gupta is non-deterministic in nature, so you may need to try multiple times before it succeeds, _even if your prompt worked perfectly_.
- We actively monitor this service. Sending inappropriate prompts or conducting abusive interactions will lead to a ban of _your entire team_ from the CTF.
- Because the backend APIs are out of our control and are known to be unstable sometimes, Nautilus Institute may adjust this challenge, including taking it down, during the game when we deem a fair game is impossible.

- Last but not least, have fun!
