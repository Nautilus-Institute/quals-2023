<p><p>It is hard to run a real-estate brokerage firm. There is a lot of math involved and everyone is always stuffing graphs in my face and asking me to "look at this projection" or "assess our risk positions", and more recently, "classify burst potential".</p>

<p>But when it comes down to it, it's about believing in the market and believing in yourself.</p>

<p>Anyway that's my rant out of the way, please take a seat and show me that new model you have been cooking up...</p>
