This test checks that mixed literal types may appear within the case block.
Note that the spec is unclear as to whether other types are implicitly cast to
the type of the implicit variable.  This test assumes the same semantics as the
built in comparison operator, namely, a guard matches the implicit variable if
both its type and value match.
