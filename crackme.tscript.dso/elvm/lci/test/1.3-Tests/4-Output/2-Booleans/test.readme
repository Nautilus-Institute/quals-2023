This test makes sure the print expression does not print booleans and issues an
error if it tries to do so.  Note the specification is unclear as to if or how
booleans are cast to strings, discussion on the forum has mentioned casting them
to "WIN" and "FAIL" for true and false, respectively, but this has not made its
way into the specification.
