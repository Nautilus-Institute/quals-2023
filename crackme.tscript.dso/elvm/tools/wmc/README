This is a compiler that goes from the target `wm` to C. The compiler source is
rust and under src/ while the runtime source is under src/crt (for C runtime).

To compile, use rust's carg:
	cargo build

Then run:
	wmc -src in.wm -o crt
Where `in.wm` is the elvm output for the target `wm` and `crt` is the crt base
directory (it will output Program.h in this directory).

At this point you can run make in the base of `crt` to build the program.
Invoke `./wm` to run the final program.
